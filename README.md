SubFix
======

Fix subtitles with ease

Downloaded any "Edited movies"? Couldn't find subtitles any where?. This tool may help you.

I still consider this as beta quality. Any contribution is welcome.

How to use:
==========

This tools is accurate to micro seconds. 

For instance,

You got video missing between timings 01:20:32 to 02:43:29( all timing is in format (hr:min:sec)), then all you need to
do is give this timing as start time and end time.

You will get new subtitle in the current directory. Enjoy..! :)
