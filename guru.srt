1
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:53,124
Gurukanth Desai
salutes the Shakti family.

2
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:06,624
Don't dream.

3
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:10,915
"We've been awake for a long time.."

4
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:17,249
"Let us sleep for some time more."

5
00:01:19,916 --> 00:01:21,749
'Dreams never come true.'

6
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,582
"There's still night left.."

7
00:01:28,916 --> 00:01:30,290
My father would say always.

8
00:01:30,375 --> 00:01:34,540
"Let the morning come."

9
00:01:35,583 --> 00:01:37,290
But I dreamt.

10
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:44,249
"We've been awake for a long time.."

11
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:48,582
"Let us sleep for some time more."

12
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:54,665
"There's still night left.."

13
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:59,832
"Let the morning come."

14
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,290
I'll work in Turkey
like Ghanshyam Das.

15
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:10,415
Which fool will give a
job to a fool like you?

16
00:02:10,916 --> 00:02:13,290
He had gone to
town for an interview.

17
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:16,332
Ghanshyam Das had taken him.
He has got the job, father.

18
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,332
I got my passport too.

19
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:19,499
Why's this happening behind my back?

20
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,749
The school results will
be out tomorrow, right?

21
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,749
Have you checked
the results in town?

22
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,582
Have you failed?

23
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:39,290
Oh, you are trying to
cover the shame with a job.

24
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:43,665
I've got a job in Turkey. Now
how does a pass or fail matter?

25
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:48,832
I'll beat you. The whole
village will laugh that..

26
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:51,124
..the math teacher's son has
failed. You'll never prosper.

27
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,374
Don't curse. He's going abroad.

28
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:58,124
Oh Mother Bhavani.
- Go to hell.

29
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,582
I can't bear that my
son has failed. Go.

30
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:08,332
Come on, leave. Come on, move.

31
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:11,665
Hey congratulations. We've done it.

32
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,915
My stepson is going abroad.

33
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:16,832
Your stepson is going abroad.

34
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:20,624
Fall at my feet, you foolish man.

35
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:22,832
You lousy woman, your
stepson is going to ride the..

36
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:26,582
..moon and go far away.
He is going abroad.

37
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:40,415
lstanbul. Look step-mother.
I've come from ldhar to lstanbul.

38
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:41,915
You run away too and come here.

39
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:45,540
Yes, but you'll be scared when
you see these huge buildings.

40
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,749
I'm not scared. Know why?

41
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:53,499
There's neither the school here,
neither father, nor his cane.

42
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:59,499
Guru. I'm so glad to see you.. come.

43
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:04,082
Come.

44
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:08,457
I wear a uniform. It's red.
And a cap too. I look good in it.

45
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,499
I work very hard.
I sell petrol cans.

46
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,749
Do you know what they say for
namaste here? Salaam Walekum.

47
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:16,999
Walekum Salaam
(Greetings in return).

48
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:34,665
You're amazing.

49
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:37,249
Hail divine Mother!

50
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:45,915
Why are you betting again?
You'll lose double of what you win.

51
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,082
Let it be, I'm telling you.

52
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:48,624
Come, this is not for us. Come.

53
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:55,999
You are amazing. Hail divine Mother!

54
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,332
One minute.

55
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:09,415
I'll open it..

56
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:17,207
Hail divine Mother! I've won!

57
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:21,749
You go.. or I go?

58
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:28,832
You shut his shop.
Guru, how did you know..

59
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:32,374
..the red ball was
under that very glass?

60
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:38,540
My eyes. Out of the three glasses,
one was smaller.

61
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:40,374
I just kept my eyes on that.

62
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:52,165
The spice business is conducted
here. Very big traders come here.

63
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,207
It's a business
that requires brains.

64
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:56,665
The sharper you are,
the luckier you are.

65
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:00,832
From tomorrow, there will be
a new trader amongst them..

66
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:02,665
Gurukanth Desai.

67
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:20,665
"You are the blue ocean.."

68
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:31,665
"I am the sand shore."

69
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:39,582
"Take me into your arms.."

70
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:49,124
"I've been yearning
from a long time."

71
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:11,040
"The shade of night and
the glimpse of moon.."

72
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:15,832
"If you want take a
glimpse at the moon."

73
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:20,582
"The shade of night and
the glimpse of moon.."

74
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:25,374
"If you want take a
glimpse at the moon."

75
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:30,249
"ln the boat of the moon,
come we have to go ashore.."

76
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:34,915
"You row slowly, the sea
shouldn't spill over.."

77
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:40,165
"O dear, collect
all the pink stars."

78
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:45,082
"O dear, collect all the
stars that are yearning."

79
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:49,832
"O dear, collect
all the pink stars."

80
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:54,832
"O dear, collect all the
stars that are yearning."

81
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:05,999
"When the blue sea awakens,
it takes you in the arms.."

82
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:11,040
"It sways and enchanted, it
kisses the face of the moonlight.."

83
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:25,207
"Your heart beats in my heart."

84
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:38,332
"I have sleepless
nights because of you."

85
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:43,915
"O dear, O dear."

86
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:49,165
"There is a pine in my heart."

87
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:53,415
"O dear, O dear."

88
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:58,665
"What does the smoke convey?"

89
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:03,540
"Smoke all around."

90
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:08,415
"The smoke always says."

91
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:28,249
"O dear, O dear."

92
00:09:36,000 --> 00:11:10,000
GURU

93
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,999
How long have you worked here?
- How long you've worked here?

94
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:28,582
Seven years.
- Seven, sir.

95
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:30,915
Do you know how to wear a tie?

96
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,832
Where's your tie? Take it out.

97
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:33,999
This?
- Wear it.

98
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:35,915
I've heard complaints about you.

99
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:38,207
But I'm very
impressed with your work.

100
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:39,832
There have been some
complaints against you..

101
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:41,415
..but he's very
impressed with your work.

102
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:44,874
I'm promoting you to the
post of sales supervisor.

103
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:50,124
You can start work tomorrow.
Congratulations. - Say thank you.

104
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:02,582
Gurukanth, aren't you happy? He
has made you a sales supervisor.

105
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:04,749
Look, Robert sir has
signed it himself. See.

106
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:07,832
It took me thirteen years to
become a sales supervisor..

107
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:10,665
..just keep that tie on.

108
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:18,582
I don't want to wear a tie.
Nor do I want this promotion.

109
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,332
Why?

110
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,415
I want to return to my village.

111
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:29,874
When did this foolish idea
occur to you, may I ask?

112
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:32,665
After wearing this tie.

113
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,582
Why?

114
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:41,832
You like my work, so
does he, then why should..

115
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:47,290
..I work for that white man?
I'll work for myself.

116
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:48,915
You'll work for yourself?

117
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:53,582
Take it in writing. You can never
do anything for yourself. Write it.

118
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:57,874
Chagan sir, my
destiny is already written.

119
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:08,665
Let me take your leave.

120
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,582
I'll miss you.

121
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,332
You're taking all the fun with you.

122
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,207
Now we'll just slog here.

123
00:13:47,250 --> 00:14:07,915
"No dear, no dear.."

124
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:35,874
"Clouds, please rain."

125
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:55,082
"The first shower of
rain is very sweet."

126
00:14:55,166 --> 00:15:01,207
"Come on, go ahead."

127
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:17,582
"No dear.."

128
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,499
"Rain."

129
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:29,457
"Clouds, please rain."

130
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:16,540
"Wet mud."

131
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,832
"Come on, let's make..

132
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:22,624
..a house from the wet mud."

133
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:30,999
"Let's put swings on the green
branches of the mango tree."

134
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:34,832
"The clouds are thundering..

135
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:38,665
..and everyone has
taken the ploughs."

136
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:47,165
"The cattle with the
bells ringing all the way."

137
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:55,832
"I swam across."

138
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:59,582
"I went to the shore."

139
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:16,582
"No dear.."

140
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:20,665
Father, I'm leaving. You
don't like what I wish for.

141
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,040
The country's become free
so why not your daughter?

142
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:29,082
I've found my partner..
bless me so that I live happily.

143
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:30,707
Your loving daughter, Sujata.

144
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:34,832
"ln dark nights..

145
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:38,582
..it will rain heavily."

146
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:42,832
"The cloud will stop
me in every alley..

147
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:46,832
..will return after a thunder."

148
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:50,832
"My home..

149
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:54,832
..and the fountain of water."

150
00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:03,207
"Don't forget or
everyone will question."

151
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:06,832
"I floated..

152
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:11,165
..and sang along."

153
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:36,665
"No dear.."

154
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:41,332
A bearded man has sent
this letter for you.

155
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:55,124
I don't have the courage
to run away and lead a life.

156
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:57,832
please forgive me, Sujata.

157
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:01,207
Yours, Bhanu patel.

158
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,290
Hey, come on. Hurry up.

159
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,332
Hey!

160
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:56,332
He is spread like a
python on the whole berth.

161
00:19:58,541 --> 00:19:59,624
I have a reservation.

162
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:05,332
Reservation is only for the night.

163
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:14,499
Look out. lts still night.

164
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,124
I can sleep comfortably
till tomorrow morning.

165
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:27,749
It's morning. ln many places in
the world, its morning, do you know?

166
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:30,582
Can't think beyond the village.

167
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:22,665
Throw it when the train stops.
It won't fly back.

168
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,207
Oh God, I can't even cry in peace.

169
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,624
Good, you woke me.
My station's come.

170
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:50,832
If you cry early in the morning..

171
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:51,999
..you'll have to cry the whole day.

172
00:21:57,541 --> 00:22:01,665
Sujata! Sujata!

173
00:22:02,916 --> 00:22:05,582
Girl, alone? - Yes. Boarded
at the last station? - Yes.

174
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:09,582
This bogey, seat number thirty two.
She drenched the whole seat crying.

175
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:10,749
Come on.
- Thanks brother.

176
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:14,832
Sujata. You are here?

177
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:17,832
Does one leave like this
without telling anyone?

178
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:20,582
I searched you everywhere.

179
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,790
Come on.

180
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:39,207
Hey, step son, where
were you all these years.

181
00:22:39,583 --> 00:22:42,165
I was saving myself from
your beatings, you lousy woman.

182
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:47,999
My brother has become an Englishman.

183
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,582
Come, Guru.

184
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:51,665
Sit. Sit.

185
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:54,332
Uncle, if he gives reason to
complain again, take care. Come.

186
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,749
Come Ramlal, look who has come.

187
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,207
Guru? I didn't recognize you.

188
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:01,874
How would you?
- You can't see after your marriage.

189
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:07,124
Has your wife come?
- Yes. - Guru, give him some money.

190
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:16,415
Give him twenty you fool.
Miser. Come.

191
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:22,415
Take it.
- Guru!

192
00:23:22,916 --> 00:23:25,082
Look how big the school has grown.

193
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:29,207
Greetings sir.

194
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,665
Even on looking at the cane,
the hand begins to burn.

195
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,124
Must have received 10
or 20 lakhs canings.

196
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:42,540
And look at the
progress you've made!

197
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:44,832
If I'd known earlier,
I would have hit..

198
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:45,999
..you till you
became the prime Minister.

199
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:53,624
Father.
- For me?

200
00:23:59,583 --> 00:24:00,665
Wonderful, dear!

201
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:04,332
How many days have you taken off?

202
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:07,457
As many as I want.
- What do you mean?

203
00:24:07,916 --> 00:24:11,290
Meaning, I don't have to do job.

204
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,374
But, your brother
said that they've..

205
00:24:14,416 --> 00:24:16,082
..promoted you and
tripled your salary.

206
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:21,207
Yes. - But I've worked
enough for the white man..

207
00:24:21,916 --> 00:24:25,165
I want to set up my business.

208
00:24:25,916 --> 00:24:27,540
My own business.

209
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:34,832
What do you know about business?
When I did business..

210
00:24:34,916 --> 00:24:36,832
..I could hardly put
food on the table.

211
00:24:36,916 --> 00:24:38,915
Everyone cannot do business.
- Father.

212
00:24:41,083 --> 00:24:43,540
Just because you failed,
doesn't mean I won't pass.

213
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,832
Keep it. It'll help
you keep track of the..

214
00:24:48,916 --> 00:24:51,665
..bad times that
will come in your life.

215
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:55,457
Ramlal, return his money.
- What? - Return his money.

216
00:24:57,333 --> 00:24:58,832
If you setup your home,
with his money your..

217
00:24:58,916 --> 00:25:00,457
..wife will run away.
You'll be ruined.

218
00:25:04,666 --> 00:25:07,582
Go.. do business. Business.

219
00:25:13,416 --> 00:25:15,290
No.. no,
- Go.

220
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:29,499
Guru what are you doing?

221
00:25:29,583 --> 00:25:31,749
The principal will scream,
don't do that. No Guru..

222
00:25:33,083 --> 00:25:34,165
Hey children, go
inside your classes.

223
00:25:43,916 --> 00:25:47,082
Do you remember how we
would run up on this hill?

224
00:25:47,166 --> 00:25:49,665
Remember, carrying huge tins,
fried snacks in one..

225
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,624
..snacks in the other!

226
00:25:51,708 --> 00:25:53,749
Idiot, you've been selling something
or the other since childhood.

227
00:25:54,208 --> 00:25:55,207
Move aside.

228
00:25:55,916 --> 00:25:58,832
Three paisa profit
for one fried snack..

229
00:25:58,916 --> 00:26:01,749
..and the fried
snacks weren't even hot.

230
00:26:02,083 --> 00:26:03,832
After climbing all
these stairs we should..

231
00:26:03,916 --> 00:26:05,999
..at least make
half a paisa profit..

232
00:26:10,083 --> 00:26:11,540
Take fried snacks.

233
00:26:11,625 --> 00:26:13,415
Snacks!

234
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:21,082
Father will never agree..
he is a money lender..

235
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,415
God of misers!

236
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:30,207
I have fifteen thousand. I
need another fifteen.. that's all.

237
00:26:30,916 --> 00:26:34,915
He won't invest. He's saved
it for my sister's wedding.

238
00:26:37,083 --> 00:26:38,624
Dowry?
- Yes.

239
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:40,332
How much?

240
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,582
Twenty five thousand.

241
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,082
I'll marry her.

242
00:26:48,916 --> 00:26:49,999
What?

243
00:26:51,666 --> 00:26:52,749
Marry her to me.

244
00:26:55,583 --> 00:26:56,832
She is my elder sister. She
is elder to me by a year..

245
00:26:56,916 --> 00:26:59,290
..so she's elder to
you by a year too.

246
00:27:00,416 --> 00:27:03,665
So what if she's a year older? One,
two years is no big deal.

247
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:07,665
Don't talk without thinking.

248
00:27:08,083 --> 00:27:09,165
Look, all I know is that..

249
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:10,749
..I'm ready to marry her.

250
00:27:11,333 --> 00:27:13,124
Then we'll be business partners.

251
00:27:13,208 --> 00:27:14,290
Fifty-fifty.

252
00:27:16,416 --> 00:27:19,290
You will receive a dowry
and make me an equal partner?

253
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,124
You'll also be part of the dowry.

254
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:33,082
How do I tell father?
What will I say?

255
00:27:33,166 --> 00:27:34,249
I won't be able to tell him.

256
00:27:35,541 --> 00:27:40,624
Why are you scared? I'm marrying,
not stealing. I'll talk to him.

257
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:25,832
Have you come to talk about
marriage? Are you a broker?

258
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,290
Go back. We are not interested?

259
00:28:32,916 --> 00:28:35,457
The last time I saw you.. you
were crying yourself hoarse.

260
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:38,749
I don't even know you. Why
would I cry in front of you?

261
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:41,832
You were crying in front of
the whole world in the train..

262
00:28:41,916 --> 00:28:44,749
..reading some Bhanu
patel's letter. - Who are you?

263
00:28:45,666 --> 00:28:48,082
Guru, who knows everything.

264
00:28:49,375 --> 00:28:52,999
Didn't you sit on my legs?
My leg broke, it still hurts.

265
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:57,124
Then go to a doctor.
What have you come here for?

266
00:28:58,083 --> 00:29:00,457
I am not here to take anything.
I've come to talk. About marriage.

267
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,082
Hold this.

268
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:08,290
Listen. Don't drag me into this.

269
00:29:15,166 --> 00:29:17,540
Hey Tulsibhen. - Oh God.
- Where is uncle?

270
00:29:24,666 --> 00:29:25,749
Uncle.

271
00:29:28,083 --> 00:29:32,124
Do you recognize me?
Do you recognize me?

272
00:29:32,208 --> 00:29:33,290
No.

273
00:29:34,583 --> 00:29:36,832
You shut down my
father's ghee shop..

274
00:29:36,916 --> 00:29:40,749
..you even took away
all the buffaloes.

275
00:29:42,916 --> 00:29:46,790
Master Kanthilal's son? - Yes. -
You're the boy who hit me on..

276
00:29:46,833 --> 00:29:49,415
..my ear with a stick
and ran away, aren't you?

277
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:52,999
I was eight years old. Shall I sit?

278
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,749
You've come to make me
deaf from my other ear?

279
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:04,874
kanthilal.
- He has no business sense.

280
00:30:06,375 --> 00:30:08,957
Now thanks to me, he
is the headmaster.

281
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:14,374
What are you? You
are in Turkey, right?

282
00:30:15,041 --> 00:30:19,082
No, I'm here. I want to do
business here with your son Jignesh.

283
00:30:20,208 --> 00:30:21,290
What business?

284
00:30:23,291 --> 00:30:24,874
Many new things are
available there abroad.

285
00:30:25,375 --> 00:30:28,749
I'll bring them and sell them here.
I'll make good profit.

286
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,749
And, what does your father say?

287
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,082
He says I'll be ruined.

288
00:30:37,291 --> 00:30:40,290
Then you will definitely
make a profit. Don't worry.

289
00:30:41,541 --> 00:30:43,624
But I've stopped
lending money these days.

290
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,290
I've to get my daughter married.

291
00:30:45,583 --> 00:30:51,749
I'll marry your daughter and..
take good care of her.

292
00:30:53,833 --> 00:30:55,749
I'll become a famous
man in five years.

293
00:31:01,166 --> 00:31:02,415
My daughter is crazy.

294
00:31:05,833 --> 00:31:08,374
Haven't you heard what those
idiot villagers are saying?

295
00:31:09,375 --> 00:31:12,207
Jobless people keep
wagging their tongues.

296
00:31:12,416 --> 00:31:14,499
There is no limit to their talks.

297
00:31:17,666 --> 00:31:20,082
There was a sickly looking,
bearded boy like buffalo.

298
00:31:22,375 --> 00:31:26,124
Used to just roam around with
a red flag and four laborers.

299
00:31:26,833 --> 00:31:28,374
She wanted to marry him.

300
00:31:31,416 --> 00:31:33,749
Have you heard this at least
or are you deaf too like me?

301
00:31:39,208 --> 00:31:42,582
I was on the same train
in which she was fleeing.

302
00:31:43,666 --> 00:31:45,415
I've seen a bit of the world.

303
00:31:47,083 --> 00:31:48,207
I know right and wrong.

304
00:31:53,583 --> 00:31:56,374
Just give me your blessing
and I'll take care of the girl.

305
00:31:56,750 --> 00:32:00,749
What? - Just give me your blessing
and I'll take care of the girl.

306
00:32:07,666 --> 00:32:08,749
I'll take your leave.

307
00:32:14,291 --> 00:32:15,374
Mother.

308
00:32:37,291 --> 00:32:57,040
"Live your life in love."

309
00:33:14,375 --> 00:33:15,832
What is this? Why
are you leaving with..

310
00:33:15,916 --> 00:33:18,290
..your
brother-in-law after marriage?

311
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,040
You are crazy. Where is your wife?

312
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:23,207
Don't scream. She's not coming.

313
00:33:23,458 --> 00:33:24,749
Why not?
- Let it be.

314
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,624
What catastrophe
is keeping her here?

315
00:33:27,875 --> 00:33:30,749
Don't know. perhaps she doesn't
like it. Maybe she doesn't like me.

316
00:33:31,208 --> 00:33:34,207
How can she not like you?
The lousy woman is mad.

317
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,915
Not all women are
sweet like my stepmother..

318
00:33:40,083 --> 00:33:41,374
Come on, bless me.

319
00:33:42,291 --> 00:33:43,957
Bless me.
- Live long.

320
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,082
I shall take your leave.

321
00:33:53,041 --> 00:33:58,040
Hey lizard! Elder brother.

322
00:33:58,833 --> 00:34:00,082
Take care.

323
00:34:06,041 --> 00:34:10,290
I know.. this isn't your wish.
But still, your blessings..

324
00:34:11,833 --> 00:34:13,499
May God give you sense..

325
00:34:14,041 --> 00:34:15,124
What else can I say?

326
00:34:24,833 --> 00:34:26,415
It's time for your train to leave.

327
00:34:59,833 --> 00:35:04,915
Don't.. don't go.

328
00:35:07,833 --> 00:35:08,915
What?

329
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,832
What if I die here all alone?

330
00:35:17,291 --> 00:35:18,832
But, you said you
didn't want to come with me.

331
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:22,582
You could have asked me again.

332
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:30,540
Look, you're not asking me even now.

333
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,165
But you don't even have any luggage?

334
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:43,582
Can't you buy me four saris?

335
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:45,832
Guru, come.

336
00:35:46,041 --> 00:35:47,124
And ticket?

337
00:35:47,416 --> 00:35:49,415
Do I need a ticket
to sit on your lap?

338
00:35:53,125 --> 00:35:55,832
Come. Come running.

339
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,415
Bye. I'll write a letter.
- Come.. come.

340
00:36:15,291 --> 00:36:21,874
"Love is wonderful.."

341
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:29,624
"The ground has
disappeared from below the feet.."

342
00:36:31,041 --> 00:36:37,499
"Love is wonderful.."

343
00:36:38,291 --> 00:36:45,290
"The ground has
disappeared from below the feet.."

344
00:36:59,666 --> 00:37:02,540
Where is the yarn market?
- That way.

345
00:37:17,833 --> 00:37:20,749
Where does all the buying and
selling happen? - Upstairs sir.

346
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:34,749
Why do they shout so much?
How will we do business here?

347
00:37:35,416 --> 00:37:39,749
Jignesh. If you don't shout.
You'll be left behind.

348
00:37:41,666 --> 00:37:45,290
And when we shout,
everyone else will shut up.

349
00:37:45,375 --> 00:37:49,082
1550! 1550.

350
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:50,582
Sir, Mathura Das?

351
00:37:51,916 --> 00:37:54,874
1350 given. Given.
- Listen.

352
00:37:55,208 --> 00:37:59,749
Are you Mathura Das?
- Could be. Why?

353
00:38:00,916 --> 00:38:03,582
I want to do yarn business.
I've come from ldhar village.

354
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:05,040
I want to do yarn
business with my own money.

355
00:38:05,125 --> 00:38:06,499
But wherever I go people
say that there's a union.

356
00:38:06,583 --> 00:38:07,665
Yes there is.

357
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:09,957
Without its permission you
can't do business over here.

358
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:11,582
You must become a member.

359
00:38:11,833 --> 00:38:14,457
1550. 1550.

360
00:38:14,541 --> 00:38:16,832
Your bid's too high. If
you go to Salem market..

361
00:38:16,916 --> 00:38:18,499
..you'll get it much cheaper.

362
00:38:18,666 --> 00:38:22,749
Quiet. Don't teach me business. If
you want to trade become a member.

363
00:38:22,875 --> 00:38:23,957
So make me a member.

364
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:26,040
There's a five year waiting period.

365
00:38:26,125 --> 00:38:27,665
It won't happen. Go on.
Don't waste my time.

366
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:29,832
But you're not
letting me do business..

367
00:38:29,916 --> 00:38:31,999
..nor are you making me a member.

368
00:38:32,125 --> 00:38:35,124
It's not in my hands.
Don't irritate me.

369
00:38:35,541 --> 00:38:38,624
Arzaan Contractor is the
president of the association.

370
00:38:39,458 --> 00:38:42,207
Azraan.. who?
- Arzaan Contractor.

371
00:38:42,291 --> 00:38:43,874
You can become a
member only with his letter.

372
00:38:44,833 --> 00:38:45,915
You won't become a member.

373
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:47,832
Are you a fortune teller?

374
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,999
I am doing business
here since 20 years.

375
00:38:52,083 --> 00:38:54,207
Twenty five thousand
like you come here everyday.

376
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,457
A villager won't do here. Go away.

377
00:38:57,666 --> 00:39:02,290
1300. 1350. Yes given.
- Mr. Das. Mr. Das.

378
00:39:04,291 --> 00:39:08,040
Yes. - I'll stand right
next to you and do business.

379
00:39:08,875 --> 00:39:11,374
And I'll wipe out twenty five
thousand like you. Just watch.

380
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,082
Come.

381
00:39:18,083 --> 00:39:19,457
What price did you quote?

382
00:39:23,875 --> 00:39:24,957
Good shot, sir.

383
00:39:28,916 --> 00:39:29,999
What do you want?

384
00:39:30,875 --> 00:39:33,832
Your letter. I want to
trade in the cloth market..

385
00:39:33,916 --> 00:39:36,832
..but they say
unless I get your letter..

386
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:38,207
..I can't become a member there.

387
00:39:39,208 --> 00:39:40,290
Come to the office.

388
00:39:40,666 --> 00:39:42,290
I have, sir. For four weeks.

389
00:39:42,416 --> 00:39:47,249
I know Bhola's entire
family history.. your watchman.

390
00:39:49,166 --> 00:39:50,249
Do you play golf?

391
00:39:52,458 --> 00:39:55,374
I play, but not this.

392
00:39:57,291 --> 00:39:58,374
Take it, play.

393
00:40:02,875 --> 00:40:07,040
This ball should go there. If
it does, you'll get the letter.

394
00:40:09,083 --> 00:40:10,749
I should put this ball
in that hole? - Yes.

395
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:13,749
And you will give me the letter?
- Of course.

396
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,582
For sure right, if I do it?

397
00:40:20,666 --> 00:40:21,749
Try it.

398
00:40:28,291 --> 00:40:29,374
Look at my good shot, sir.

399
00:40:33,833 --> 00:40:36,207
What's your name?
- Gurukanth Desai.

400
00:40:36,833 --> 00:40:38,165
You'll give me the letter?

401
00:40:38,416 --> 00:40:39,749
Ok. I'll see.

402
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,665
I've collected money for
business with great difficulty.

403
00:40:44,416 --> 00:40:45,499
I'll take care.

404
00:40:47,041 --> 00:40:49,749
ln my village, help
is never forgotten.

405
00:40:50,166 --> 00:40:52,957
It'll happen. If
you don't mind. Yes?

406
00:40:53,833 --> 00:40:57,374
Thank you, sir. You'll see,
business will benefit with me.

407
00:40:58,166 --> 00:40:59,249
Two paisa.
- No.

408
00:40:59,375 --> 00:41:01,874
Two paisa is too
much for that. Here.

409
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:09,374
Let me get the change!
Where's the fire?

410
00:41:09,583 --> 00:41:10,665
I've got something for you.

411
00:41:10,958 --> 00:41:12,040
For me?
- Yes.

412
00:41:12,666 --> 00:41:14,082
What?
- I'll show you.

413
00:41:14,958 --> 00:41:16,499
What have you bought for me?
- Come.

414
00:41:26,666 --> 00:41:27,749
Have you bought this for me?

415
00:41:29,041 --> 00:41:30,749
Yes, don't you like it?

416
00:41:32,041 --> 00:41:33,832
I thought you'll get
me lots of saris..

417
00:41:33,916 --> 00:41:38,749
..jewelry, diamonds, 8-10 big cars.

418
00:41:40,541 --> 00:41:41,624
I have brought it all.

419
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:44,165
I'll show you.

420
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:45,332
You can see it now.

421
00:41:49,208 --> 00:41:50,290
Could you see it?

422
00:41:51,333 --> 00:41:53,999
No, but the whole world will see us.

423
00:41:58,041 --> 00:42:03,082
I can see it.. a
big house.. a palace.

424
00:42:04,041 --> 00:42:09,874
I can see the lintel.. burnt
on the gas. No food tonight.

425
00:42:13,625 --> 00:42:19,624
I see a factory.. very big.
Even bigger than Burma Shell.

426
00:42:20,916 --> 00:42:23,624
I see clothes in the wash.. wet..

427
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:26,499
..you'll have to go in
your underwear tomorrow.

428
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:36,832
I can see you, fat, with a
Rs.900,000 necklace, fat bangles..

429
00:42:36,916 --> 00:42:40,832
..walking with a swagger..
all of five hundred pounds.

430
00:42:41,833 --> 00:42:43,165
I'll never be fat.

431
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:47,832
Ok slim one! Wearing
Rs.900,000 necklace..

432
00:42:47,916 --> 00:42:51,582
..fat bangles..
walking with a swagger.

433
00:42:51,666 --> 00:42:52,749
Very happy.

434
00:42:55,416 --> 00:42:56,957
Very, very, very, happy.

435
00:42:59,208 --> 00:43:00,290
With you.

436
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:06,582
Guru.
- The brother-in-law is here.

437
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:11,999
It's over. It's all over.

438
00:43:12,125 --> 00:43:15,290
What?
- Our business is over. - What?

439
00:43:15,833 --> 00:43:17,165
But what happened?

440
00:43:18,208 --> 00:43:22,749
That Contractor's
rejected our application.

441
00:43:24,125 --> 00:43:25,665
Can't be. He gave me his word.

442
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:28,374
Am I lying to you? I'm
coming from his office.

443
00:43:28,583 --> 00:43:30,999
He tore up our
application after reading it.

444
00:43:31,333 --> 00:43:32,874
So do we go back to
the village now?

445
00:43:34,833 --> 00:43:36,582
If we don't, we'll
be out on the streets.

446
00:43:37,958 --> 00:43:40,374
I say, let's pack our bags
and go to the village.

447
00:43:41,083 --> 00:43:42,165
What is there for dinner sister?

448
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,165
Who are you?

449
00:44:08,583 --> 00:44:09,665
I live here.

450
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:11,874
I don't live here, okay?

451
00:44:12,875 --> 00:44:14,374
Then why are you
staring at my building?

452
00:44:15,958 --> 00:44:19,082
Why? Do I need a
letter even to look now?

453
00:44:21,208 --> 00:44:22,832
The building is on the road,
the road is the Government's..

454
00:44:22,916 --> 00:44:24,749
..these eyes are mine..
the country is free.

455
00:44:25,291 --> 00:44:26,957
I can stare at whoever,
whenever I want.

456
00:44:27,541 --> 00:44:29,374
Don't bug me early in the morning.

457
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:30,874
Go watch your dog piss.

458
00:44:32,208 --> 00:44:38,832
Very good.. anger early in the
morning is very good. Let's walk.

459
00:44:39,083 --> 00:44:40,165
What's your name?

460
00:44:40,333 --> 00:44:44,749
Manik Das Gupta.. - You've
turned your city into a club.

461
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:46,957
This one can't come here.
That one can't come here.

462
00:44:47,166 --> 00:44:49,499
You just wear a suit
and talk in English.

463
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:52,624
They've turned
Bombay into a dog. Dog!

464
00:44:54,083 --> 00:44:59,374
Good. Being angry with
Bombay is very good.

465
00:44:59,541 --> 00:45:04,582
Not on Bombay. I am angry with
one man.. I want to slap him.

466
00:45:05,208 --> 00:45:08,082
The president of our
traders association..

467
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:10,832
Arzaan Contractor. He
promised me four months ago..

468
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:12,749
..that he'll give me a
letter of membership.

469
00:45:12,958 --> 00:45:14,665
Then he tore up my
application and threw it away.

470
00:45:16,583 --> 00:45:19,582
He doesn't wake up before ten
o'clock, how will you slap him?

471
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:21,874
Do you know him?

472
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:23,749
Since he was this little.

473
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:25,957
Can you do something for me?

474
00:45:26,666 --> 00:45:28,874
I don't believe in giving
or taking recommendations.

475
00:45:29,583 --> 00:45:34,165
But you look like a big
social communist leader.

476
00:45:34,291 --> 00:45:37,749
You should help the poor.
Against this rich Contractor.

477
00:45:38,083 --> 00:45:39,457
And if I say no?

478
00:45:39,666 --> 00:45:43,957
That's a problem.
I can't hear the word 'no.'

479
00:45:45,291 --> 00:45:46,957
I like it. I like it very much.

480
00:45:48,083 --> 00:45:49,582
Come to my office.

481
00:45:52,208 --> 00:45:53,749
Will you get the letter for me?

482
00:45:55,166 --> 00:45:56,749
I'll make sure your voice is heard.

483
00:45:57,333 --> 00:46:01,082
How? - I own a
newspaper Swatantra Samachar.

484
00:46:01,333 --> 00:46:03,374
If you're speaking the truth then..

485
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,624
I will fight your war.

486
00:46:05,958 --> 00:46:08,832
But if you've lied, I'll slap you.

487
00:46:09,291 --> 00:46:13,040
I've just arrived in Bombay;
I haven't learnt to lie yet.

488
00:46:14,833 --> 00:46:16,957
Good, come tomorrow.

489
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:26,832
Trading big shot Arzaan Contractor..

490
00:46:26,916 --> 00:46:28,832
..the country is free but..

491
00:46:28,916 --> 00:46:31,832
..when will the trade
markets be free from..

492
00:46:31,916 --> 00:46:35,624
..their president,
Arzaan Contractor?

493
00:46:36,625 --> 00:46:41,665
Mr. Contractor considers himself
the undisputed lord of the union..

494
00:46:42,291 --> 00:46:46,165
..and Mr. Gurukanth
Desai as his enemy.

495
00:46:48,083 --> 00:46:51,040
Now nobody can stop Guru
from becoming a businessman.

496
00:46:53,083 --> 00:46:54,290
A very big businessman.

497
00:46:54,416 --> 00:46:58,749
Bigger than anybody..
am I talking too big?

498
00:47:00,208 --> 00:47:02,624
A bit.

499
00:47:03,833 --> 00:47:05,499
Mathura Das.

500
00:47:12,291 --> 00:47:13,415
Here I am, right beside you.

501
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:18,999
You have come. But you won't last.

502
00:47:21,416 --> 00:47:23,874
There are a dime a dozen like you..

503
00:47:26,291 --> 00:47:28,082
Those whom you have seen,
only you know about them.

504
00:47:28,833 --> 00:47:32,874
I only know that there's just
one person like me here. Only Guru.

505
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:43,165
Greetings.
- Greetings.

506
00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:48,957
Greetings.
- Greetings. Move. - Move.

507
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:53,374
Greetings.
- Greetings.

508
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:54,582
Greetings.

509
00:47:55,666 --> 00:47:58,040
I didn't know you had so
many complaints against me.

510
00:47:59,625 --> 00:48:05,749
You should have spoken to me.
Not in the papers, like this.

511
00:48:05,833 --> 00:48:08,624
How do we tell you sir?
It's difficult to meet you.

512
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:09,832
Today you're in
trouble so you've come here..

513
00:48:09,916 --> 00:48:12,290
..or you are found only at the club.

514
00:48:15,541 --> 00:48:17,374
It seems like this
Union doesn't require me.

515
00:48:18,208 --> 00:48:20,749
And I don't like
staying where I'm not needed.

516
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:26,582
That is why I am resigning
from presidency. I am resigning.

517
00:48:26,833 --> 00:48:30,165
No. - Let him go,
someone else will come along.

518
00:48:30,291 --> 00:48:33,165
Quiet. You needn't
go contractor sir.

519
00:48:34,041 --> 00:48:36,665
He has decided, Mr. Das.

520
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:40,540
Now even God can't make him
change his decision, isn't it?

521
00:48:43,041 --> 00:48:46,290
My decision won't change.
But, times will.

522
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:48,332
Anything could
happen tomorrow itself.

523
00:48:49,416 --> 00:48:52,582
And if it does,
don't come crying to me.

524
00:48:57,250 --> 00:48:59,749
If we're going to be that scared,
how'll we do business?

525
00:49:01,583 --> 00:49:05,582
Don't worry.. we are the fearless.

526
00:49:08,333 --> 00:49:09,540
What was your name?

527
00:49:10,583 --> 00:49:17,624
Not was, it still is.. and
will always be. Gurukanth Desai.

528
00:49:35,291 --> 00:49:36,832
Where is that villager, Guru?

529
00:49:37,958 --> 00:49:39,040
Where?

530
00:49:41,166 --> 00:49:44,165
Oh uncle.
- Okay, okay.

531
00:49:44,291 --> 00:49:45,374
What is it?

532
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:47,499
You opened a new office
and didn't even call me?

533
00:49:47,916 --> 00:49:49,832
Meenu, what do we do with him..

534
00:49:49,916 --> 00:49:54,374
..wring his neck or
break his teeth? - Both.

535
00:49:55,041 --> 00:49:56,124
Shall I do it?

536
00:49:56,833 --> 00:49:57,915
Which tooth shall I break?

537
00:49:58,750 --> 00:50:00,499
This one. Come on mare.

538
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:01,832
My name is Meenakshi.

539
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:06,582
Jalkukdi. - Meenu. - Jalkukdi.
- No. - Yes. - No.

540
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:08,874
She won't accept defeat.

541
00:50:09,208 --> 00:50:12,374
Uncle, it's too
small a place for you..

542
00:50:13,291 --> 00:50:15,957
He's lying. He was
afraid you would scold him.

543
00:50:16,375 --> 00:50:19,290
That he doesn't have faith in
himself and has to depend on God.

544
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:20,665
He was right.

545
00:50:22,083 --> 00:50:25,624
No. God and I don't get along.

546
00:50:26,208 --> 00:50:28,499
If you offer it as a
sweet I'll eat it.

547
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:30,749
You'll get both or neither.

548
00:50:32,333 --> 00:50:33,957
She's smarter than you.

549
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,832
Why don't you treat the
offering as a sweet and..

550
00:50:38,916 --> 00:50:40,040
..I'll treat the
vermilion as just a colour.

551
00:50:40,875 --> 00:50:42,499
You will have your way.

552
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:47,832
Such a struggle for a tiny sweet!
- Hail divine Mother.

553
00:50:48,833 --> 00:50:49,915
Who is this villager?

554
00:50:50,041 --> 00:50:51,957
My brother-in-law and partner.

555
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:53,582
What will you do?

556
00:50:53,833 --> 00:50:54,915
Cotton.
- Suit business.

557
00:50:57,250 --> 00:51:00,082
Very good.. a fight
on the very first day.

558
00:51:20,833 --> 00:51:21,915
My brother is sleeping outside.

559
00:51:23,833 --> 00:51:25,207
I am not asking you to wake him.

560
00:52:21,833 --> 00:52:22,915
What will you do now?

561
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:25,624
What do you think?

562
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:28,290
You beast. What work will
you do to earn a living?

563
00:52:30,583 --> 00:52:31,832
You brought us here
like a big leader..

564
00:52:31,916 --> 00:52:34,040
..how are you going
to clothe and feed us?

565
00:52:37,833 --> 00:52:38,915
polyester.

566
00:52:40,291 --> 00:52:41,374
What's that?

567
00:52:43,041 --> 00:52:47,290
Clothe.. Shiny..

568
00:52:48,833 --> 00:52:54,624
..naughty just like you.

569
00:52:55,041 --> 00:52:58,207
You beast.. I made a
big mistake marrying you.

570
00:53:00,125 --> 00:53:02,665
I can't understand whether you..

571
00:53:02,708 --> 00:53:04,374
..love your yarn more or me.

572
00:53:07,125 --> 00:53:08,207
Should I tell you?

573
00:53:13,333 --> 00:53:16,374
Das was saying polyester
business is dangerous. - Let him.

574
00:53:16,833 --> 00:53:20,082
Are you brainless? The whole
world is into cotton and you..

575
00:53:20,166 --> 00:53:21,374
When you see the profit..

576
00:53:21,458 --> 00:53:24,457
..you'll say wow Guru,
how intelligent you are!

577
00:53:25,875 --> 00:53:26,999
How much did you invest?

578
00:53:27,458 --> 00:53:28,540
All the money.

579
00:53:28,666 --> 00:53:29,999
Oh God, you'll kill us.

580
00:53:30,666 --> 00:53:32,957
You've shut it down.
We will be ruined.

581
00:53:33,041 --> 00:53:34,665
You'll know when we are really dead.

582
00:53:36,291 --> 00:53:37,374
Why did you shut it down?
-This won't do.

583
00:53:37,458 --> 00:53:41,082
What's the matter?
- This won't do.

584
00:53:44,416 --> 00:53:46,957
What happened? - They've
shut down the market. - Why?

585
00:53:47,291 --> 00:53:48,749
They say it's gambling.

586
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:51,207
Gambling?
- Yes.

587
00:53:52,333 --> 00:53:54,832
But the fun of business is
predicting which price will rise..

588
00:53:54,916 --> 00:53:56,832
..and fall, where the
losses and profits are..

589
00:53:56,916 --> 00:53:58,749
..that shows the
acumen of the businessman.

590
00:53:58,833 --> 00:54:01,040
You think that. The
Government calls that gambling.

591
00:54:02,291 --> 00:54:03,374
Gambling.

592
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:06,749
Then tell the Government to
stop lotteries. That is gambling.

593
00:54:07,291 --> 00:54:09,832
The race at Mahalakshmi,
astrology. All that's gambling too.

594
00:54:09,916 --> 00:54:12,165
You came and destroyed our business.

595
00:54:13,666 --> 00:54:14,749
Not me.

596
00:54:15,041 --> 00:54:17,207
Your friend Contractor has
done it. And that too with bribes.

597
00:54:19,583 --> 00:54:20,665
No problem.

598
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:22,207
We'll start our market here.

599
00:54:22,291 --> 00:54:24,249
Yes.
- Wait! Wait!

600
00:54:24,333 --> 00:54:25,832
Guru, what are you doing?
You'll go to jail and..

601
00:54:25,916 --> 00:54:27,457
..send everybody else in as well.

602
00:54:28,958 --> 00:54:33,457
See this.
- What is this?

603
00:54:33,583 --> 00:54:34,832
A Government notice
from an I.A.S. officer..

604
00:54:34,916 --> 00:54:38,499
Do you know the meaning of this?
It's the law now. Law!

605
00:54:38,625 --> 00:54:40,832
Mr. Das, if a law
can be made in a day..

606
00:54:40,916 --> 00:54:42,165
..then it can also be
changed in a day too.

607
00:54:42,250 --> 00:54:43,832
Nothing will be changed.
k.R. Menon..

608
00:54:43,916 --> 00:54:46,665
..the I.A.S. officer is very strict.
He doesn't listen to anybody.

609
00:54:47,958 --> 00:54:49,290
Everything is ruined.

610
00:55:02,125 --> 00:55:04,207
Who are you? Who are you?
- Come in. come in.

611
00:55:04,291 --> 00:55:06,832
Come. Keep the goods there.
Come.. this way.

612
00:55:06,916 --> 00:55:08,915
Who is that? Come.

613
00:55:09,375 --> 00:55:10,749
Greetings sir.
- Hey wait!

614
00:55:10,833 --> 00:55:11,915
Are you Mr. k.R. Menon sir?

615
00:55:12,333 --> 00:55:13,832
Who are you? -That cloth trading..

616
00:55:13,916 --> 00:55:15,957
..it stopped because
of your men right?

617
00:55:16,125 --> 00:55:20,040
What is this? - That notice
has your signature, right. Come.

618
00:55:20,125 --> 00:55:21,207
Come. Come.

619
00:55:21,291 --> 00:55:23,999
Unni, ask him to stop.
- Come in.

620
00:55:24,291 --> 00:55:25,957
Come.. come.. come..

621
00:55:26,041 --> 00:55:28,540
There.
- Stop it.

622
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:31,582
All the goods are yours.

623
00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:33,290
What nonsense? Who are you?

624
00:55:33,833 --> 00:55:35,832
My father-in-law is a businessman,
moneylender.

625
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:37,832
In my village, if people
who borrow money from him..

626
00:55:37,916 --> 00:55:40,374
..don't pay back, he
mortgages everything.

627
00:55:40,875 --> 00:55:42,165
If clarified butter shop is..

628
00:55:42,250 --> 00:55:43,332
..shut down then
people give him buffaloes.

629
00:55:43,833 --> 00:55:45,915
I had a polyester
shop that you shut down.

630
00:55:46,875 --> 00:55:47,957
Now all this is yours.

631
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:53,749
It's top quality polyester, sir.
Make clothes for the children.

632
00:55:54,125 --> 00:55:57,665
Wear suits. You'll
look good. Greetings.

633
00:55:57,750 --> 00:55:58,832
Come on everybody. Come on.

634
00:56:07,458 --> 00:56:15,457
Gurukanth Desai.

635
00:56:15,583 --> 00:56:19,457
Just see who it is.
- Gurukanth Desai!

636
00:56:20,166 --> 00:56:22,040
Menon sir, you? Greetings.

637
00:56:22,833 --> 00:56:24,582
I've been looking
for you for four days.

638
00:56:25,166 --> 00:56:27,957
You should have at least
given your name, address.

639
00:56:28,458 --> 00:56:32,540
Jignesh. Yes? - Come. Mr.
Menon, A very big I.A.S. officer.

640
00:56:32,875 --> 00:56:36,207
Look, my record is impeccable.

641
00:56:36,416 --> 00:56:38,832
If the higher
authorities find out about the..

642
00:56:38,916 --> 00:56:41,290
..polyester, I will lose my job.

643
00:56:41,416 --> 00:56:42,957
What can I do about that sir?

644
00:56:43,166 --> 00:56:46,499
Take it all back,
neighbours have begun to ask.

645
00:56:46,583 --> 00:56:47,832
Sir, I can understand.
But until the..

646
00:56:47,916 --> 00:56:50,499
..market opens I can't
take the goods back.

647
00:56:50,833 --> 00:56:52,040
Are you threatening me?

648
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:53,832
No sir, but the other traders were..

649
00:56:53,916 --> 00:56:56,499
..also going to come to your
house to leave their goods.

650
00:56:56,833 --> 00:56:58,874
What nonsense is this?
What can I do?

651
00:56:58,958 --> 00:57:00,749
How can I re-open the market?

652
00:57:01,583 --> 00:57:04,040
I'm an illiterate villager,
I don't know much.

653
00:57:04,333 --> 00:57:05,832
But if you locked the market doors..

654
00:57:05,916 --> 00:57:07,957
..then you must have the keys too.

655
00:57:08,208 --> 00:57:09,749
And if I say no?

656
00:57:09,916 --> 00:57:10,999
What?

657
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:13,165
And if I say 'no'?

658
00:57:13,958 --> 00:57:15,749
I don't understand the word 'no'.

659
00:57:17,958 --> 00:57:20,832
And one more thing,
the traders are asking..

660
00:57:20,916 --> 00:57:23,499
..for your residence address
everyday. Should I give it?

661
00:57:35,833 --> 00:57:55,749
Glory to Guru!

662
00:57:55,833 --> 00:57:58,749
You are great.
- Wonderful.

663
00:57:59,291 --> 00:58:03,374
Brother Guru,
you've done a great job.

664
00:58:08,291 --> 00:58:11,832
Guru has come. He has
brought gifts for all.

665
00:58:11,958 --> 00:58:14,040
What?
- He's given one to Mr. Sharma.

666
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:16,290
What have you brought for me?

667
00:58:20,416 --> 00:58:23,624
You forgot the lame Jalkukdi?

668
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:26,832
Close your eyes.

669
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:41,499
Don't open them. Don't open them.

670
00:58:44,333 --> 00:58:45,415
Now open them.

671
00:58:46,083 --> 00:58:48,582
A wedding sari!
- Of course.

672
00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:50,499
You'll marry me?

673
00:58:50,583 --> 00:58:51,665
For seven lifetimes..

674
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:55,499
Grandpa.
- Very nice.

675
00:58:56,416 --> 00:58:58,040
I'll show it to everyone.

676
00:58:58,291 --> 00:59:01,415
Go.
- So Brother Guru?

677
00:59:02,291 --> 00:59:03,749
Why are you calling me brother Guru?

678
00:59:03,875 --> 00:59:04,957
I'm like your son.

679
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:07,207
Everyone addresses
you with this name.

680
00:59:07,416 --> 00:59:08,749
The name suits you.

681
00:59:08,875 --> 00:59:15,874
Grandpa. Come on, get up.
Leave that. Come on, get up.

682
00:59:20,458 --> 00:59:22,832
I know you're not even..

683
00:59:22,916 --> 00:59:24,290
..going to touch this..

684
00:59:25,083 --> 00:59:27,082
..you look like
Gandhi in this loin cloth.

685
00:59:27,750 --> 00:59:29,832
But when you travel abroad..

686
00:59:29,916 --> 00:59:36,957
..and it's very cold you can
make a coat like Nehru and wear it.

687
00:59:37,291 --> 00:59:38,374
It'll look very nice.

688
00:59:41,333 --> 00:59:44,457
You are bribing me with
Gandhi and Nehru's names.

689
00:59:45,375 --> 00:59:50,832
No. I don't know how
to shake hands and..

690
00:59:50,916 --> 00:59:54,749
..say thank you in English.
That's why.

691
00:59:55,833 --> 00:59:56,957
If you don't like it..

692
00:59:57,041 --> 01:00:01,499
..then break both my neck
and teeth. Come on, bless me.

693
01:00:02,125 --> 01:00:04,665
This mischief is
what I like about you..

694
01:00:05,125 --> 01:00:08,207
..suddenly you speak with
honesty and intelligence.

695
01:00:09,291 --> 01:00:10,832
Don't ever let go of this habit.

696
01:00:12,666 --> 01:00:13,749
Grandpa.

697
01:00:14,750 --> 01:00:18,415
Whatever happens, I'll
never let go of you.

698
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:20,665
I promise.

699
01:01:30,250 --> 01:01:34,499
"You have to come."
- Want more? - No, thanks.

700
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,332
please, I don't want.

701
01:01:36,833 --> 01:01:38,249
Gulp it down in one shot.

702
01:01:38,833 --> 01:01:41,582
Come on, bottoms up!
- No. No.

703
01:01:41,833 --> 01:01:44,332
He won't drink, his
wife will scream at him.

704
01:01:46,333 --> 01:01:48,415
All wives scold..

705
01:01:49,083 --> 01:01:50,832
..if you drink a bit,
you'll hear less of it.

706
01:01:54,416 --> 01:01:55,749
I apologize for being late.

707
01:01:55,833 --> 01:01:57,165
Cut it, dear.

708
01:01:57,583 --> 01:02:00,832
The work was such. I was
doing our trial balance..

709
01:02:01,333 --> 01:02:06,082
..our profits are up
by 300% in six months.

710
01:02:08,583 --> 01:02:10,582
And the price of polyester
has gone through the roof!

711
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,082
Very good.

712
01:02:12,833 --> 01:02:15,832
But don't relax,
because if the Shakti..

713
01:02:15,916 --> 01:02:18,915
..family has worked
for 18 hours till today..

714
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,499
..we will now work 25
hours per day. - 25 hours!

715
01:02:21,583 --> 01:02:24,332
Ask why?
- Why?

716
01:02:25,166 --> 01:02:27,665
Because, the Shakti
family will not only trade..

717
01:02:28,416 --> 01:02:29,915
..we will manufacture
kela silk (polyester).

718
01:02:30,166 --> 01:02:31,415
We are opening a factory.

719
01:02:32,833 --> 01:02:34,332
Very good.

720
01:02:34,583 --> 01:02:35,832
Foreign machines will produce the..

721
01:02:35,916 --> 01:02:38,499
..English named
kela silk.. polyester.

722
01:02:38,583 --> 01:02:39,665
polyester.

723
01:02:39,750 --> 01:02:42,832
Just because you've
bought a car doesn't mean..

724
01:02:42,916 --> 01:02:45,082
..that you dream of
opening a factory.

725
01:02:45,166 --> 01:02:49,499
Shut up! Unless you dream
you'll be stuck to Idhai.. drink..

726
01:02:49,666 --> 01:02:54,332
But.. - We've also seen the land.
25 acres right next to your village.

727
01:02:55,333 --> 01:02:57,582
Walk carefully.. don't
be in such a hurry..

728
01:02:59,166 --> 01:03:01,582
Who wants to walk? I want to run..

729
01:03:01,666 --> 01:03:04,249
I'm carrying you in my arms,
don't move, you'll fall.

730
01:03:04,833 --> 01:03:05,915
And the money?

731
01:03:06,583 --> 01:03:09,332
Are you Contractor? Will
the banks give you a loan?

732
01:03:09,416 --> 01:03:12,665
To hell with Contractor and banks..

733
01:03:12,750 --> 01:03:17,499
..we will go to the public and
start a factory. Give ten rupees..

734
01:03:17,833 --> 01:03:21,415
..and become the owner..
public issue.

735
01:03:22,166 --> 01:03:24,832
If the factory earns,
so will everyone.

736
01:03:25,166 --> 01:03:27,415
permission for the public
issue will come in one month.

737
01:03:27,583 --> 01:03:31,999
Fantastic! Let's have
another one on this!

738
01:03:32,583 --> 01:03:34,415
Have it! Come on, have it!
- Guru.

739
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,499
You didn't ask me even once.

740
01:03:38,083 --> 01:03:39,624
You could've at
least taken my opinion.

741
01:03:41,833 --> 01:03:47,665
My dear dowry sweet.
You wouldn't have..

742
01:03:47,750 --> 01:03:50,832
..let us sell polyester,
or anything else.

743
01:03:52,833 --> 01:03:55,499
You were about to pack up
and go back to the village.

744
01:03:56,583 --> 01:03:57,832
We are partners in business..

745
01:03:58,750 --> 01:04:00,082
..it's not just yours.

746
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:08,832
You just stay behind me..
and watch the world.

747
01:04:09,583 --> 01:04:10,915
Don't poke your nose in between.

748
01:04:13,916 --> 01:04:16,582
If you stick your nose in,
I'll turn you into polyester..

749
01:04:16,666 --> 01:04:18,082
..and sell you to a foreign lady.

750
01:04:20,583 --> 01:04:21,665
Jignesh.

751
01:04:29,833 --> 01:04:33,415
Little prince is upset.. no problem.

752
01:04:33,833 --> 01:04:34,915
I'll pacify him and bring him back..

753
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,332
..but empty the bottle. Understood?

754
01:04:38,416 --> 01:04:39,832
Yes, we will empty it.

755
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:47,249
Hey, wait.
Where are you going?

756
01:04:48,583 --> 01:04:50,332
Come back. Everyone's watching.

757
01:04:50,416 --> 01:04:51,665
I can't get along with him.

758
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:56,499
This is not a silly game
that you get upset and leave.

759
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:01,832
Come back. Should I
fall at your feet? Come.

760
01:05:03,083 --> 01:05:04,165
I'm going to the village.

761
01:05:04,250 --> 01:05:09,249
We'll all go together and put up a
huge board. Shakti factory. Come.

762
01:05:10,916 --> 01:05:12,832
I don't want to do
anything with him.

763
01:05:14,583 --> 01:05:17,415
people will say that
you're jealous of him.

764
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:19,249
Who will say?
- Even I will..

765
01:05:19,583 --> 01:05:20,749
You've gone mad and blind.

766
01:05:20,833 --> 01:05:25,582
Hey brother Jignesh. Your
problem is with me. Fight with me.

767
01:05:25,916 --> 01:05:27,582
Speak properly to your sister. Okay?

768
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,249
You're senseless. You've forgotten..

769
01:05:31,333 --> 01:05:33,832
..that he's looked after both of
us. Learn to understand a person.

770
01:05:33,916 --> 01:05:38,665
He only understands money. Do
you know why he married you?

771
01:05:39,833 --> 01:05:42,915
He was a true friend. He
married a girl who was eloping.

772
01:05:43,083 --> 01:05:45,249
He would have married you
even if you were handicapped.

773
01:05:45,583 --> 01:05:47,832
You know why? Tell her..

774
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:51,665
Why are you talking like a child?

775
01:05:51,750 --> 01:05:53,499
He married you for dowry.

776
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:55,915
Tell him not to lie.

777
01:05:57,750 --> 01:05:58,832
Ask him.

778
01:06:00,166 --> 01:06:01,249
Guru bhai.

779
01:06:04,166 --> 01:06:06,249
Father had promised a
big dowry, 25 thousand.

780
01:06:06,416 --> 01:06:08,749
That's why he got married. He
wanted to start his business.

781
01:06:10,250 --> 01:06:11,499
Tell him not to lie..

782
01:06:12,250 --> 01:06:15,582
Sister, you're just
capital for him.

783
01:06:23,166 --> 01:06:24,249
He's lying.

784
01:06:31,666 --> 01:06:32,832
Is this true?

785
01:06:33,833 --> 01:06:37,249
"Don't go as everyone
look like stranger to me.."

786
01:06:37,333 --> 01:06:40,415
"I feel lonely.."

787
01:06:40,583 --> 01:06:45,165
"I don't feel good without you."

788
01:06:45,333 --> 01:06:49,832
"I don't feel good."

789
01:07:16,333 --> 01:07:33,999
"O dear, what is life without you.."

790
01:07:34,583 --> 01:07:47,832
"Without you, the nights
are tasteless, O beloved.."

791
01:07:47,916 --> 01:07:56,165
"The nights are dry and
there is solitude all around."

792
01:07:57,833 --> 01:08:10,499
"Without you, the nights
are tasteless, O beloved.."

793
01:08:19,833 --> 01:08:37,165
"O dear, what is life without you.."

794
01:09:16,583 --> 01:09:19,832
"Don't go away."

795
01:09:19,916 --> 01:09:23,249
"Don't go leaving me alone."

796
01:09:23,416 --> 01:09:25,832
"Don't go..

797
01:09:25,916 --> 01:09:31,082
..as there will be no
fun in the rainy season."

798
01:09:31,166 --> 01:09:34,332
"Without you, the nights
are tasteless, O beloved.."

799
01:09:34,416 --> 01:09:47,665
"Now I cannot
spend it without you.."

800
01:09:47,916 --> 01:09:53,915
"Without you, the nights
are tasteless, O beloved.."

801
01:10:02,833 --> 01:10:07,082
"O dear, what is life without you.."

802
01:10:31,166 --> 01:10:34,832
"Without you."

803
01:10:36,166 --> 01:10:42,749
"Without you the moonlit is dim."

804
01:10:42,833 --> 01:10:49,415
"The sunshine looks farce."

805
01:10:49,583 --> 01:10:52,499
"Without you the gold looks copper."

806
01:10:52,833 --> 01:10:55,832
"Life is precious with you."

807
01:10:56,083 --> 01:11:01,582
"Come, as I am
having sleepless nights."

808
01:11:11,250 --> 01:11:15,332
"O dear, what is life without you.."

809
01:11:16,166 --> 01:11:29,332
"Without you, the nights
are tasteless, O beloved.."

810
01:11:29,416 --> 01:11:38,999
"The nights are dry and
there is solitude all around."

811
01:11:48,000 --> 01:12:05,249
"O dear, what is life without you.."

812
01:12:05,583 --> 01:12:08,999
Fight with the whole world,
but not with me.

813
01:12:12,666 --> 01:12:14,915
If you're with me, I
can win the whole world.

814
01:12:22,083 --> 01:12:24,832
Then why are you
hanging on to me? Come on..

815
01:12:28,583 --> 01:12:29,665
Where?

816
01:12:32,833 --> 01:12:33,915
To beat the world!

817
01:12:44,833 --> 01:12:46,499
Hey elder brother,
you also touch it.

818
01:12:49,250 --> 01:12:52,082
Hey Mr. Ghanshyam.
When did you come?

819
01:12:52,250 --> 01:12:53,665
I've come on time, haven't I?

820
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:03,165
Brother Guru! Brother Guru!
- Yes.

821
01:14:03,250 --> 01:14:05,165
How was the Europe and America tour?

822
01:14:05,250 --> 01:14:08,415
It was a very successful one.
There was only one difficulty.

823
01:14:08,666 --> 01:14:11,665
I didn't get to eat food
cooked by her. I starved.

824
01:14:12,916 --> 01:14:14,832
You're being called the
business king of lndia.

825
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,749
Do you have Shakti shares?
- Yes.

826
01:14:16,833 --> 01:14:18,582
Then you are lndia's
business king too.

827
01:14:19,916 --> 01:14:21,832
Guru brother. people
are pointing fingers..

828
01:14:21,916 --> 01:14:22,999
..at your growth.

829
01:14:23,083 --> 01:14:24,165
You're growing too fast.

830
01:14:25,833 --> 01:14:29,665
This is a race. And I run
to win, not for pleasure.

831
01:14:30,250 --> 01:14:31,332
Look, Meenu.

832
01:14:32,333 --> 01:14:36,749
Whatever you own is mine.
Now tell me, will you marry me?

833
01:14:36,833 --> 01:14:40,665
No.
- Hey Jalkukdi. - Gurukanth.

834
01:14:41,416 --> 01:14:43,999
You are so nicely decked up.
Just like a bride.

835
01:14:44,083 --> 01:14:45,665
Really? Actually I knew.

836
01:14:45,833 --> 01:14:48,499
That's why this parsi uncle's
been troubling me since long.

837
01:14:48,833 --> 01:14:51,332
I told him move on,
my husband's coming.

838
01:14:53,833 --> 01:14:54,999
So when are you marrying me?

839
01:14:55,833 --> 01:14:57,832
Leave elder sister. Let's
get into my car and run away.

840
01:14:57,916 --> 01:14:59,415
Can you cook like her?

841
01:14:59,666 --> 01:15:00,749
Hello, Mr. Guru.

842
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,165
I'm talking about love and
you're talking about your stomach.

843
01:15:03,333 --> 01:15:04,832
How do you live with him?

844
01:15:05,083 --> 01:15:08,665
With great difficulty. - Greetings
brother Guru. - Where's grandpa?

845
01:15:08,833 --> 01:15:10,832
America. He'll be back in two weeks.

846
01:15:10,916 --> 01:15:12,165
Brother Guru!
Greetings sister-in-law.

847
01:15:12,250 --> 01:15:13,832
Contractor sir. -Greetings.

848
01:15:13,916 --> 01:15:14,999
Meenu.
- Hello.

849
01:15:15,083 --> 01:15:16,249
Brother Guru,
someone has been waiting..

850
01:15:16,333 --> 01:15:17,499
..since long to meet you. Come.

851
01:15:19,166 --> 01:15:22,499
Sister. Are you expecting?

852
01:15:23,750 --> 01:15:26,999
How did you know? I
haven't even told him as yet.

853
01:15:27,333 --> 01:15:31,332
Your face is glowing. And it
will be a girl, just like me.

854
01:15:33,833 --> 01:15:37,915
Dad. Gurukanth Desai.

855
01:15:39,583 --> 01:15:41,249
So you're brother Guru.

856
01:15:41,333 --> 01:15:44,665
And you're the senior Mr.
Contractor. It's a pleasure.

857
01:15:45,166 --> 01:15:46,749
The pleasure is entirely mine.

858
01:15:47,833 --> 01:15:50,415
I've a present for you.

859
01:15:50,833 --> 01:15:52,915
That's why I wanted you
to come to the wedding.

860
01:15:53,833 --> 01:15:56,832
But I brought a present only
for your daughter. Not for you.

861
01:15:59,083 --> 01:16:04,915
A blank cheque. Your
mathematics is excellent.

862
01:16:05,833 --> 01:16:10,832
So fill it up. With any
number that you like. Fill it up.

863
01:16:11,916 --> 01:16:14,332
Everything has a price,
brother Guru.

864
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,665
Where you've reached today,
is amazing.

865
01:16:19,666 --> 01:16:21,999
You've made your own way.

866
01:16:22,333 --> 01:16:24,499
It's wonderful.

867
01:16:25,166 --> 01:16:29,582
But the way ends here.

868
01:16:50,916 --> 01:16:55,915
Don't put it down. If
you keep it down today..

869
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,499
..you might not get another
opportunity tomorrow, to pick it up.

870
01:17:20,583 --> 01:17:21,665
Lousy old man.

871
01:17:23,166 --> 01:17:24,665
He wants to buy me.

872
01:17:26,333 --> 01:17:27,999
He says everything has a price.

873
01:17:28,583 --> 01:17:29,999
Will he put a price tag on me too?

874
01:17:31,416 --> 01:17:35,582
150 years. What he made in
150 years, I made in 10 years.

875
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,665
Is there any match? No.

876
01:17:38,833 --> 01:17:40,249
What's going on?

877
01:17:43,583 --> 01:17:46,832
Cashier. Get hold
of all our friends..

878
01:17:46,916 --> 01:17:51,665
..from the press.
All of them. Right now.

879
01:17:52,250 --> 01:17:55,749
Call them, go to their homes,
wake them up, do what you have to.

880
01:17:57,166 --> 01:17:58,832
From tomorrow, every
newspaper in the..

881
01:17:58,916 --> 01:18:00,415
..country should carry
an expose on Contractor.

882
01:18:02,083 --> 01:18:04,082
Tell them. That Contractor's suits..

883
01:18:04,166 --> 01:18:06,999
..and cars shine but
his machines are useless.

884
01:18:08,833 --> 01:18:11,915
Old, rusted, very cheap.

885
01:18:13,583 --> 01:18:14,665
Cashier.

886
01:18:16,750 --> 01:18:22,165
Contractor's name should
become a curse. A curse.

887
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:25,832
"Brother Guru,
brother Guru has come.."

888
01:18:25,916 --> 01:18:27,749
"He will cause a stir.."

889
01:18:27,916 --> 01:18:30,082
"Brother Guru,
brother Guru has come.."

890
01:18:30,166 --> 01:18:32,165
"He will cause a stir.."

891
01:18:32,333 --> 01:18:34,249
"Brother Guru,
brother Guru has come.."

892
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:36,499
"He will cause a stir.."

893
01:18:36,833 --> 01:18:38,665
"Brother Guru,
brother Guru has come.."

894
01:18:38,833 --> 01:18:40,915
"He will cause a stir.."

895
01:19:02,833 --> 01:19:04,832
"Brother Guru,
brother Guru has come.."

896
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,082
"He will cause a stir.."

897
01:19:07,333 --> 01:19:09,249
"Brother Guru,
brother Guru has come.."

898
01:19:09,416 --> 01:19:11,499
"He will cause a stir.."

899
01:19:12,833 --> 01:19:13,915
"Brother Guru,
brother Guru has come.."

900
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:30,415
This is the Swatantra Samachar..
The lndependent.

901
01:19:32,166 --> 01:19:34,832
This very newspaper has
destroyed the British.

902
01:19:35,833 --> 01:19:37,165
It didn't get scared of anybody.

903
01:19:38,833 --> 01:19:42,582
It has fought for ideals and
principles. But it never got sold.

904
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:52,082
I was away for a month and you all
sold it. You stabbed me in the back.

905
01:19:53,166 --> 01:19:57,582
ln a month you've dressed the
newspaper in Guru's safari suits.

906
01:20:02,750 --> 01:20:03,832
Hey.
- Yes.

907
01:20:04,333 --> 01:20:05,415
Who gave you this?

908
01:20:06,583 --> 01:20:11,832
Guru?
- Yes. - Take it off.

909
01:20:14,250 --> 01:20:16,582
I said take it off!

910
01:20:20,666 --> 01:20:21,749
That too.

911
01:20:25,833 --> 01:20:28,165
Now pick up both of them and
throw them in the dustbin.

912
01:20:32,833 --> 01:20:36,582
Editor sir.
- Yes? - I hear you've a new car.

913
01:20:39,583 --> 01:20:43,415
Don't you have shame? Don't
you have even a little shame?

914
01:20:46,666 --> 01:20:48,332
We have to apologize to the country.

915
01:20:51,166 --> 01:20:54,165
Tomorrow morning's edition
will have an apology letter.

916
01:20:54,416 --> 01:20:57,665
The page has already been composed.
- Then stop it! Stop it!

917
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:00,915
You've made false allegations.

918
01:21:01,750 --> 01:21:05,082
You have supported the wrong man.
So you have to apologize.

919
01:21:07,750 --> 01:21:14,165
Go. Go! Send for Shyam Saxena.

920
01:21:14,583 --> 01:21:18,165
Shyam. - Have you
gone deaf? Shyam Saxena.

921
01:21:18,583 --> 01:21:21,165
Send him and tell Guru to come too.
- Yes sir.

922
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,165
Grandpa.

923
01:21:33,333 --> 01:21:36,582
These sweets have come
especially for you from Junaghar.

924
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,749
What's wrong? You look troubled.
Can I do something?

925
01:21:41,833 --> 01:21:43,582
You can do anything, Isn't it?
- Yes.

926
01:21:44,833 --> 01:21:46,332
Nothing is difficult for you.

927
01:21:47,833 --> 01:21:50,332
You just keep throwing
your money everywhere.

928
01:21:52,833 --> 01:21:56,165
Grandpa, there are all
kinds of people in the world.

929
01:21:56,333 --> 01:22:01,832
And everyone has a price. What
say brother? Here. Sweetmeat.

930
01:22:02,333 --> 01:22:04,832
That's why I carry two
kinds of slippers with me.

931
01:22:05,250 --> 01:22:07,415
One made of silver and one of gold.

932
01:22:09,250 --> 01:22:14,832
I hit them with whichever of
the two they want and move ahead.

933
01:22:14,916 --> 01:22:16,582
And which slipper
do you have for me?

934
01:22:25,833 --> 01:22:27,082
For you, it's Khadi (cotton cloth).

935
01:22:30,166 --> 01:22:32,165
So you will hit me
with a slipper too.

936
01:22:33,833 --> 01:22:39,499
Shyam. What do you
think of brother Guru?

937
01:22:43,416 --> 01:22:44,499
What can I say?

938
01:22:45,833 --> 01:22:48,332
Feel free and say it.

939
01:22:51,833 --> 01:22:55,582
Brother Guru is the biggest
hope of the lndian industry.

940
01:22:57,166 --> 01:22:58,332
A champion businessman.

941
01:22:59,833 --> 01:23:02,165
I am not asking you
for an advertisement.

942
01:23:03,083 --> 01:23:04,499
Speak honestly.

943
01:23:05,666 --> 01:23:09,832
To speak honestly, he is a disease
who should be locked up in jail..

944
01:23:09,916 --> 01:23:15,082
..and the keys
thrown away in the drain.

945
01:23:17,833 --> 01:23:21,999
Hey Jalkukdi. Who is this great
man who is praising me so much?

946
01:23:22,833 --> 01:23:24,499
And why do you feel this way?

947
01:23:25,750 --> 01:23:27,165
His growth rate is 400%.

948
01:23:27,833 --> 01:23:28,915
Unbelievable.

949
01:23:29,833 --> 01:23:31,665
But he is increasing
corruption and greed..

950
01:23:32,333 --> 01:23:35,415
..at double the rate
that he is growing..

951
01:23:36,083 --> 01:23:38,665
..with his gold and silver slippers.

952
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:42,499
Have you called me to beat
me with a stick Grandpa?

953
01:23:45,333 --> 01:23:47,082
I've not even started yet.

954
01:23:50,916 --> 01:23:52,082
Shyam.

955
01:23:53,333 --> 01:23:56,999
If you and I break the
law we would be scared.

956
01:23:58,750 --> 01:24:01,832
But he is proud of breaking the law.

957
01:24:03,416 --> 01:24:05,582
And he doesn't just
break or bend the law.

958
01:24:07,083 --> 01:24:10,082
He buries it and then
builds a beautiful park on it..

959
01:24:10,333 --> 01:24:11,915
..the one with
flowers and fountains.

960
01:24:13,833 --> 01:24:16,832
And after some time people
forget that this place is stolen.

961
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:19,832
I think his factory at Veraval..
- Grandpa..

962
01:24:24,833 --> 01:24:27,665
If you want to tell me something
why don't you just tell me straight?

963
01:24:30,250 --> 01:24:37,582
Shyam, can you strip him
before the whole world?

964
01:24:41,833 --> 01:24:43,999
The whole world wears my clothes.

965
01:24:44,833 --> 01:24:46,582
You'll have to strip everyone.

966
01:24:48,333 --> 01:24:52,165
Can you stop this man or not?

967
01:24:55,833 --> 01:24:56,915
No.

968
01:24:59,750 --> 01:25:06,832
Neither him, nor this newspaper,
nor you, nor your khadi army.

969
01:25:12,166 --> 01:25:15,165
I'll stop him. I'll stop him.

970
01:25:47,833 --> 01:25:48,915
Brother Shyam..

971
01:25:51,833 --> 01:25:56,749
This cloth and weight are a
result of a lot of hard work.

972
01:25:59,166 --> 01:26:00,832
You also work hard to fight with me.

973
01:26:02,833 --> 01:26:06,332
If you want to fight Gurukanth,
become Gurukanth.

974
01:26:09,166 --> 01:26:12,915
But there is only one Gurukanth.

975
01:26:13,083 --> 01:26:15,165
"Guru brother,
Guru brother has come.."

976
01:26:15,333 --> 01:26:17,332
"He will cause a stir.."

977
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:19,332
Guru brother,
Guru brother has come.."

978
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:21,665
"He will cause a stir.."

979
01:26:21,833 --> 01:26:23,832
"Guru brother, Guru brother."

980
01:26:36,833 --> 01:26:38,332
You look very beautiful.

981
01:26:38,833 --> 01:26:44,832
It is so easy to say that. When you
give birth to a child, you'll know.

982
01:26:45,833 --> 01:26:48,082
Walk around with a huge
tummy like a bedding roll.

983
01:26:48,583 --> 01:26:52,249
Vomit from morning to night.
And on top of that, get kicked!

984
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:56,832
A child is small but it is so..

985
01:26:58,166 --> 01:27:01,832
What do you want? That my
tummy too should become like this?

986
01:27:05,166 --> 01:27:07,665
I look at least 3-4 months pregnant.

987
01:27:10,166 --> 01:27:12,665
Boy or girl?

988
01:27:17,166 --> 01:27:18,499
It's not just one.

989
01:27:19,250 --> 01:27:20,832
Then? Twins?

990
01:27:22,166 --> 01:27:24,415
There are 25000 people inside.

991
01:27:25,833 --> 01:27:26,915
What are they saying?

992
01:27:45,666 --> 01:27:46,749
Guru Brother .

993
01:27:47,166 --> 01:27:49,832
Guru Brother. Mike.

994
01:28:00,833 --> 01:28:03,999
Welcome Shakti family!

995
01:28:04,583 --> 01:28:05,665
Enjoy.

996
01:28:07,833 --> 01:28:09,832
It is for the first time
in India that a company's..

997
01:28:09,916 --> 01:28:11,082
..meeting is being held like this.

998
01:28:11,583 --> 01:28:15,082
You know why? The Shakti
family is so big that..

999
01:28:15,166 --> 01:28:16,999
..it can't fit into any small place.

1000
01:28:19,666 --> 01:28:20,999
Welcome all of you.

1001
01:28:22,833 --> 01:28:25,832
My special apologies to our
brothers from Gujarat..

1002
01:28:25,916 --> 01:28:27,832
..who've skipped
their afternoon siesta.

1003
01:28:33,666 --> 01:28:39,999
Do you know, a few years ago
Shakti family was in debt.

1004
01:28:40,666 --> 01:28:43,165
From the bank, government.

1005
01:28:44,833 --> 01:28:48,665
Then I came to you with my
arms spread. What did you do?

1006
01:28:50,166 --> 01:28:51,832
You emptied your vaults.

1007
01:28:52,583 --> 01:28:56,999
The result? Today, we are free.

1008
01:29:01,083 --> 01:29:03,165
We are doing
business with our own money.

1009
01:29:04,166 --> 01:29:08,249
Our own investment. Our own profit.

1010
01:29:14,833 --> 01:29:18,165
When I first came to Bombay..
it's been many years..

1011
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:22,082
..I had come with just
two shirts and a coat.

1012
01:29:25,166 --> 01:29:30,332
But today the whole of lndia..

1013
01:29:30,416 --> 01:29:34,499
..wears our clothes!

1014
01:29:35,083 --> 01:29:36,165
Clap.

1015
01:29:41,416 --> 01:29:44,832
But I know you aren't happy.
- We're happy, brother Guru.

1016
01:29:44,916 --> 01:29:46,915
No. No. You are not happy at all.

1017
01:29:47,916 --> 01:29:48,999
Why?

1018
01:29:50,333 --> 01:29:56,999
You'll be happy only when
we open four more factories.

1019
01:29:59,583 --> 01:30:05,082
So Shakti family, what do you say?
Shall we open four more factories?

1020
01:30:06,833 --> 01:30:10,499
Do you want to become
lndia's biggest company?

1021
01:30:13,416 --> 01:30:19,332
I've grown old. Can't hear you.
Say it even louder. - Yes!

1022
01:30:27,166 --> 01:30:28,499
How many Shakti shares do you have?

1023
01:30:29,166 --> 01:30:30,249
I'm a reporter.

1024
01:30:32,083 --> 01:30:33,582
He's a magician.

1025
01:30:33,833 --> 01:30:34,999
Write good things about him.

1026
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:38,915
poverty will disappear if we
have ten men like brother Guru.

1027
01:30:40,833 --> 01:30:42,832
I will definitely write.
Make sure to read..

1028
01:30:42,916 --> 01:30:44,332
..next Saturday's
Swatantra Samachar.

1029
01:30:44,416 --> 01:30:45,499
Fine.

1030
01:30:45,583 --> 01:30:51,582
"Come on gamble. 1 , 2, 3, 4.."

1031
01:30:51,833 --> 01:30:54,165
Balu. That lighthouse
shouldn't come in the frame. - Yes.

1032
01:30:54,250 --> 01:30:55,499
This shouldn't look like lndia.

1033
01:30:55,666 --> 01:30:57,249
And make sure the print looks old.

1034
01:30:57,333 --> 01:30:59,249
They shouldn't look like
today's pictures. -Yes sir.

1035
01:30:59,333 --> 01:31:01,582
You want to click fake
photos and pass them as truth?

1036
01:31:03,083 --> 01:31:04,165
If it's a lie, then let ..

1037
01:31:04,250 --> 01:31:05,999
.. your brother Guru come
forward and say it's a lie.

1038
01:31:06,083 --> 01:31:07,165
Just move aside.

1039
01:31:07,583 --> 01:31:09,332
Tear it. The powder should be seen.

1040
01:31:09,416 --> 01:31:11,082
You come this side.
And all of you come out.

1041
01:31:11,333 --> 01:31:12,915
Balu, ready?
- Ready.

1042
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:14,749
You've made up the entire story.

1043
01:31:14,833 --> 01:31:17,249
It's written by brother Guru. I'm
just presenting it. Balu click them.

1044
01:31:17,833 --> 01:31:23,499
"Come on gamble, let
it go as it goes.."

1045
01:31:23,583 --> 01:31:24,749
"Let's see what happens."

1046
01:31:24,833 --> 01:31:26,249
They dumped cartons like this?

1047
01:31:26,416 --> 01:31:29,999
Yes. And all empty ones. There
was lime powder in some of them.

1048
01:31:30,083 --> 01:31:31,832
Sent to fake companies
with fake addresses.

1049
01:31:32,166 --> 01:31:35,165
Meaning, he sent
empty cartons abroad..

1050
01:31:36,166 --> 01:31:38,415
..and showed full cartons as export.

1051
01:31:38,583 --> 01:31:39,832
And doing this he also got the..

1052
01:31:39,916 --> 01:31:43,332
..polyester import license.
700% profit.

1053
01:31:44,583 --> 01:31:45,832
You have to hand it to brother Guru.

1054
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:49,332
He found a way to
profits even from empty boxes!

1055
01:31:49,416 --> 01:31:52,332
But the way was of lies.
All fraud and cheating.

1056
01:31:52,666 --> 01:31:54,332
But even you're lying.

1057
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,165
This is the truth. Shakti's truth.

1058
01:31:58,500 --> 01:31:59,582
Naked truth.

1059
01:32:20,833 --> 01:32:22,749
These are all lies! Fake!

1060
01:32:23,833 --> 01:32:25,749
They must have shot it
somewhere here in Bombay..

1061
01:32:25,833 --> 01:32:26,915
..and are passing it off as Arabia.
- Yes.

1062
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:30,582
First of all, I'll stop
advertising in Grandpa's paper.

1063
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:32,499
Why should they earn from us?

1064
01:32:32,583 --> 01:32:33,749
No.

1065
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,665
lncrease them in
Swatantra Samachar(newspaper).

1066
01:32:38,833 --> 01:32:41,832
If we were giving
them 10 advertisements..

1067
01:32:42,166 --> 01:32:43,249
..in a month, make it 30.

1068
01:32:43,416 --> 01:32:44,499
But brother Guru..

1069
01:32:44,583 --> 01:32:49,832
Balance sheets, profits, new
companies. publish all of them.

1070
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,665
I wish that when Grandpa
wakes up every morning..

1071
01:32:54,166 --> 01:32:55,999
..he should know about our progress.

1072
01:32:57,333 --> 01:32:58,915
Brother Guru..
- What happened doctor?

1073
01:32:59,750 --> 01:33:01,582
The same thing that happens
usually with your company.

1074
01:33:03,750 --> 01:33:07,415
Double profit.
Congratulations, they are twins!

1075
01:33:10,333 --> 01:33:13,749
Cashier sir. Send a
telegram to my father.

1076
01:33:13,833 --> 01:33:15,249
Tell him Guru is coming.
- Yes.

1077
01:33:21,583 --> 01:33:24,415
My God Suju! There
really are two of them.

1078
01:33:27,333 --> 01:33:28,415
Name.

1079
01:33:31,333 --> 01:33:34,332
Disha.
- I only thought of one.

1080
01:33:36,833 --> 01:33:39,582
Drishti. Even I had thought of one.

1081
01:33:42,833 --> 01:33:45,665
A bonus. Buy one-get one free.

1082
01:33:48,833 --> 01:33:53,582
It's a pair!

1083
01:33:53,916 --> 01:34:03,415
Buy one, get one free.

1084
01:34:03,500 --> 01:34:04,832
Is it so?

1085
01:34:06,833 --> 01:34:08,832
By one, get one free.

1086
01:34:20,583 --> 01:34:22,665
"It is a pair.."

1087
01:34:22,750 --> 01:34:24,665
"Not one but two.."

1088
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,165
"It is a pair.."

1089
01:34:27,250 --> 01:34:28,832
"Not one but two.."

1090
01:34:28,916 --> 01:34:32,582
"Tell me Guru.."

1091
01:34:33,333 --> 01:34:35,249
"Tell me what will happen.."

1092
01:34:36,583 --> 01:34:40,665
"If there were two pairs of one.."

1093
01:34:41,083 --> 01:34:44,749
"If there were two pairs of wives.."

1094
01:34:44,833 --> 01:34:48,665
"Tell me Guru.."

1095
01:34:49,333 --> 01:34:51,582
"Tell me what would have happened.."

1096
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:56,582
"The chains of the feet
would also be not one, but two.."

1097
01:34:56,916 --> 01:35:00,999
"The handcuffs also would
also be not one, but two.."

1098
01:35:01,416 --> 01:35:06,082
"Night and day, I
would have chanted.."

1099
01:35:17,583 --> 01:35:21,915
"Tulsi behan, not one, but two."

1100
01:35:22,166 --> 01:35:24,332
"It is a pair.."

1101
01:35:24,416 --> 01:35:26,332
"Not one but two.."

1102
01:35:26,833 --> 01:35:28,999
"It is a pair.."

1103
01:35:29,083 --> 01:35:30,499
"Not one but two.."

1104
01:35:30,583 --> 01:35:34,165
"Tell me Guru.."

1105
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,832
"Tell me what will happen.."

1106
01:35:57,666 --> 01:36:01,915
"Brother Babu, greetings.
Brother Raju greetings.."

1107
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:07,082
"Sister Kanta,
greetings. What is your name.."

1108
01:36:07,166 --> 01:36:13,082
"The round moon, if
there were two moons.."

1109
01:36:13,375 --> 01:36:17,624
"There would be one for the
day and one for the night.."

1110
01:36:18,166 --> 01:36:22,582
"During load-shedding, the
moon would have been lighted up.."

1111
01:36:22,666 --> 01:36:26,832
"The people would have said,
how did this happen.."

1112
01:36:27,166 --> 01:36:31,832
"I got a kick, the cannabis gave
me a high, that's how it happened.."

1113
01:36:31,916 --> 01:36:35,915
"If one and one make a pair."

1114
01:36:36,416 --> 01:36:40,165
"Then there would be
two wives at home."

1115
01:36:40,250 --> 01:36:44,582
"Tell me Guru.."

1116
01:36:45,583 --> 01:36:52,332
"pair."

1117
01:36:52,416 --> 01:36:57,249
"Dear."

1118
01:36:57,333 --> 01:37:01,415
"pair."

1119
01:37:01,666 --> 01:37:04,499
"Not one, not one but two.."

1120
01:37:05,916 --> 01:37:10,665
"We will lift the palanquin.."

1121
01:37:10,833 --> 01:37:13,832
"Not one, not one but two.."

1122
01:37:14,583 --> 01:37:23,832
"Come on a mare."

1123
01:37:24,083 --> 01:37:26,415
"You have gone crazy.."

1124
01:37:26,500 --> 01:37:28,499
"Your face is broken.."

1125
01:37:28,666 --> 01:37:31,082
"Your imitation is fake.."

1126
01:37:31,250 --> 01:37:33,165
"Not one, not one but two.."

1127
01:37:33,250 --> 01:37:35,582
"You have gone crazy.."

1128
01:37:35,666 --> 01:37:37,749
"Your face is broken.."

1129
01:37:37,833 --> 01:37:40,415
"Your imitation is fake.."

1130
01:37:40,500 --> 01:37:42,415
"Not one.."

1131
01:37:42,500 --> 01:37:47,332
"Leave cannabis and break your leg..

1132
01:37:47,416 --> 01:37:51,832
..come and sit at home."

1133
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:53,915
"Not one.."

1134
01:37:54,166 --> 01:37:58,582
"Little droplets make ocean."

1135
01:37:58,833 --> 01:38:02,499
"I am getting high on the cannabis."

1136
01:38:02,583 --> 01:38:06,415
"My doll."

1137
01:38:06,833 --> 01:38:09,582
"Guru's doll."

1138
01:38:10,166 --> 01:38:14,582
"Stay awake at night."

1139
01:38:42,333 --> 01:38:46,665
"Tulsi behan, Not one, but two."

1140
01:38:49,166 --> 01:38:50,832
Shakti's fake strength.

1141
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:54,082
Brother Guru plays a
new game of corruption.

1142
01:38:54,250 --> 01:38:57,332
Shakti's new shares are
selling at high prices..

1143
01:38:57,500 --> 01:39:01,665
..but the shares are being
bought by brother Guru's men.

1144
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:03,665
You are bent on crucifying him.

1145
01:39:05,166 --> 01:39:08,165
Don't you think the more
you write the bigger..

1146
01:39:08,250 --> 01:39:10,832
..the hero he will become?
- Really.

1147
01:39:11,833 --> 01:39:14,915
Even I've applied
for his new shares.

1148
01:39:16,333 --> 01:39:17,415
You?

1149
01:39:18,583 --> 01:39:23,665
I've to think of my future.
Who else will? You?

1150
01:39:26,250 --> 01:39:29,915
What happened?

1151
01:39:30,416 --> 01:39:32,665
What happened? - I don't know sir.
- What do you mean you don't know?

1152
01:39:32,833 --> 01:39:34,499
Go check the power room.
- Yes sir.

1153
01:39:34,833 --> 01:39:39,082
Shankar, come here.
- Murpani! Any news?

1154
01:39:42,166 --> 01:39:44,832
Who could be behind this? 3 guesses.

1155
01:39:44,916 --> 01:39:46,665
Gurukanth.. Gurukanth.. Gurukanth.

1156
01:39:49,833 --> 01:39:51,999
The power failure is..
- Only in our press.

1157
01:39:52,083 --> 01:39:55,082
What do you mean?
- The power is off only here? - Yes.

1158
01:39:55,583 --> 01:39:59,582
You go yourself and ensure printing
resumes in 15 minutes. - Yes sir.

1159
01:40:00,916 --> 01:40:03,582
I think we won't have
power till late at night.

1160
01:40:08,583 --> 01:40:11,165
I don't care. You?

1161
01:40:12,583 --> 01:40:13,665
I don't either.

1162
01:40:17,833 --> 01:40:19,499
You know what I want to do?

1163
01:40:20,833 --> 01:40:23,999
You want to have tea. With ginger.

1164
01:40:25,833 --> 01:40:26,999
I want to sing.

1165
01:40:28,833 --> 01:40:32,665
So sing. It's your
grandfather's press.

1166
01:40:36,333 --> 01:40:37,749
I want to dance.

1167
01:40:37,916 --> 01:40:45,665
Fast, fast then slow
then fast, then slow..

1168
01:40:46,500 --> 01:40:50,249
I want to live for
three days, without pain.

1169
01:40:54,333 --> 01:40:55,832
Without multiple sclerosis..

1170
01:40:55,916 --> 01:41:00,832
..medicines,
wheelchair. Just three days.

1171
01:41:01,833 --> 01:41:06,165
"The morning light.."

1172
01:41:06,250 --> 01:41:07,415
Why are you looking
at me like that?

1173
01:41:09,500 --> 01:41:15,999
"Of the speechless morning,
it hums.."

1174
01:41:16,750 --> 01:41:21,915
"It is the noise of the light.."

1175
01:41:27,666 --> 01:41:29,249
You were going to
come to bless them.

1176
01:41:29,833 --> 01:41:30,915
I had to come to you.

1177
01:41:31,166 --> 01:41:34,832
Good. It's good that they are girls.

1178
01:41:36,750 --> 01:41:38,582
They'll be like just like you.

1179
01:41:41,333 --> 01:41:43,582
Make them brave, independent.

1180
01:41:44,666 --> 01:41:47,082
Get them used to
living without the father.

1181
01:41:48,083 --> 01:41:50,582
perhaps I have to send
your father to jail.

1182
01:41:54,833 --> 01:41:55,999
How long are you going to fight?

1183
01:41:57,500 --> 01:41:58,915
Till I win.

1184
01:42:00,583 --> 01:42:02,165
Don't you love him at all?

1185
01:42:05,916 --> 01:42:07,165
Don't you think of him as your son?

1186
01:42:12,166 --> 01:42:13,832
I asked him the same question..

1187
01:42:14,500 --> 01:42:15,582
..and got the same answer.

1188
01:42:18,583 --> 01:42:19,665
Silence.

1189
01:42:22,750 --> 01:42:26,415
What is this fight about? Why
are both of you behaving like this?

1190
01:42:29,833 --> 01:42:34,749
Where's your husband?
- Office.

1191
01:42:52,833 --> 01:42:57,999
Are you calling him up?
He doesn't know I'm here.

1192
01:43:00,500 --> 01:43:01,915
Don't do that grandpa.

1193
01:43:02,833 --> 01:43:03,915
Guru Brother.

1194
01:43:05,666 --> 01:43:07,415
Manik Das Gupta here.

1195
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,665
Don't send your wife to beg.

1196
01:43:22,583 --> 01:43:24,749
Tell Motwani to check the proof.
- Yes.

1197
01:43:42,833 --> 01:43:44,499
Are you all right,
sir? Are you all right?

1198
01:43:45,166 --> 01:43:49,415
Why are you hitting the car?
Hit me! Why are you running away?

1199
01:43:50,166 --> 01:43:56,165
I know who sent you!
Tell him I'm not scared!

1200
01:44:14,500 --> 01:44:15,582
Guru...you?

1201
01:44:15,666 --> 01:44:19,665
Did you send them? - Whom?
- You send them, didn't you?

1202
01:44:20,250 --> 01:44:21,832
What are you talking about?

1203
01:44:21,916 --> 01:44:23,499
You know what I'm talking about.

1204
01:44:25,416 --> 01:44:28,165
They're after your blood.

1205
01:44:28,333 --> 01:44:29,415
So?

1206
01:44:30,833 --> 01:44:39,582
Just wanted to scare him.
Done with just Rs.15000.

1207
01:44:39,750 --> 01:44:40,832
I don't know what I would've done..

1208
01:44:40,916 --> 01:44:42,499
..if it were anyone
else who had done this.

1209
01:44:43,833 --> 01:44:45,832
He is like a father to me..

1210
01:44:45,916 --> 01:44:47,749
..and one never hits their father.

1211
01:44:50,583 --> 01:44:52,832
Meaning if someone
hurls a stone at us..

1212
01:44:52,916 --> 01:44:58,082
..we don't do anything.
We remain quiet?

1213
01:44:58,166 --> 01:44:59,332
Don't stay quiet.

1214
01:44:59,916 --> 01:45:02,832
Move ahead. If they write,
let them write..

1215
01:45:02,916 --> 01:45:05,915
..if they publish, let them,
if they hurl stones, let them.

1216
01:45:06,833 --> 01:45:09,832
If they talk about yesterday, let
them. We will talk about tomorrow.

1217
01:45:09,916 --> 01:45:14,082
We've come this far
together with our hard work.

1218
01:45:15,250 --> 01:45:18,332
Four sheets of paper can't
bring Shakti Corporation down.

1219
01:45:21,333 --> 01:45:25,832
Listen, tighten your belt.
Because until..

1220
01:45:25,916 --> 01:45:29,832
..we build a bigger
petro-chemical company..

1221
01:45:29,916 --> 01:45:31,499
..than Burma Shell, we
won't rest. Understood?

1222
01:45:35,833 --> 01:45:37,332
Why doesn't it rain the whole year?

1223
01:45:39,416 --> 01:45:45,415
Why isn't there cold in Bombay?
Why doesn't it snow?

1224
01:45:46,416 --> 01:45:47,582
Will you marry me?

1225
01:45:53,250 --> 01:45:55,832
It would be such fun if the
whole sea gets filled with snow.

1226
01:45:56,833 --> 01:45:58,915
Didn't you hear or you
don't want to marry me?

1227
01:46:01,833 --> 01:46:04,249
I want you to drown
in the sea and die.

1228
01:46:06,583 --> 01:46:07,665
Then how will I marry?

1229
01:46:09,750 --> 01:46:13,332
Do you know what this is?
- Multiple Sclerosis.

1230
01:46:15,250 --> 01:46:16,332
And do you know what that is?

1231
01:46:16,416 --> 01:46:18,999
A disease of the central
nervous system that has no cure.

1232
01:46:20,333 --> 01:46:22,499
It is one thing to read about
it and another to live with it.

1233
01:46:25,250 --> 01:46:27,832
I wake up in the morning.
Apart from waking..

1234
01:46:27,916 --> 01:46:29,832
..up in the morning,
I can't do anything.

1235
01:46:32,416 --> 01:46:35,582
I've had an attack every
other month since I was ten.

1236
01:46:36,916 --> 01:46:39,582
Nothing remains beautiful,
everything seems empty.

1237
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:48,082
If Hamsa is careless,
then the bed gets wet..

1238
01:46:52,083 --> 01:46:54,665
Can you sleep on a rubber sheet?

1239
01:46:55,500 --> 01:47:01,165
"The sweet smell of the night.."

1240
01:47:03,250 --> 01:47:04,332
When do we marry?

1241
01:47:06,416 --> 01:47:09,832
"I love silences.." - You're
making fun of me, aren't you?

1242
01:47:10,833 --> 01:47:12,665
Your grandpa had
said the same thing.

1243
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,165
I tried explaining but
he wouldn't understand.

1244
01:47:18,333 --> 01:47:19,832
I'll go very far
away in four hundred..

1245
01:47:19,916 --> 01:47:24,499
..and nineteen days..
- And then?

1246
01:47:24,916 --> 01:47:26,499
"Brightness.."

1247
01:47:26,583 --> 01:47:27,832
Then I want every
single one of those..

1248
01:47:27,916 --> 01:47:29,665
..four hundred and nineteen days.

1249
01:47:29,750 --> 01:47:34,832
"Of the speechless morning,
it hums.."

1250
01:47:35,500 --> 01:47:36,582
Marry me.

1251
01:47:36,666 --> 01:47:39,582
"I love the light.."

1252
01:47:39,833 --> 01:47:40,915
No.

1253
01:47:43,833 --> 01:47:48,582
please marry me, Meenu.
- No.

1254
01:47:49,833 --> 01:47:51,249
Meenu.
- No.

1255
01:48:01,416 --> 01:48:07,082
"The thrilling moments.."

1256
01:48:08,750 --> 01:48:14,582
"The clouds of love.."

1257
01:48:16,333 --> 01:48:29,249
"The clouds playing with snow.."

1258
01:48:40,416 --> 01:48:45,165
After six months! The new minister's
given us ten minutes! Ten minutes.

1259
01:48:46,166 --> 01:48:48,749
If his uncle was there, I
would've got a meeting like this.

1260
01:48:50,583 --> 01:48:52,832
Ten minutes is enough
for you, brother Guru.

1261
01:48:56,583 --> 01:49:00,832
No Cashier. You can only
say no in ten minutes.

1262
01:49:02,416 --> 01:49:03,832
I've had it with hearing a no.

1263
01:49:06,916 --> 01:49:08,582
Don't feel bad, brother Guru.

1264
01:49:11,333 --> 01:49:14,415
Just do some magic on this minister.

1265
01:49:15,833 --> 01:49:17,582
Or we'll all be in trouble.

1266
01:49:19,666 --> 01:49:20,749
How?

1267
01:49:24,833 --> 01:49:29,582
Brother Guru.
Careful. He's an honest man.

1268
01:49:56,583 --> 01:50:01,749
Greetings sir.
- You're in the papers everyday.

1269
01:50:03,750 --> 01:50:05,832
Your uncle was a very
good friend of mine.

1270
01:50:06,166 --> 01:50:08,749
It isn't necessary that
his friends are mine too.

1271
01:50:09,833 --> 01:50:11,832
A lot is being written against you.

1272
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:15,332
There's a saying in my village.

1273
01:50:16,500 --> 01:50:18,832
When people speak against you..

1274
01:50:18,916 --> 01:50:20,749
..then you must be progressing.

1275
01:50:21,500 --> 01:50:23,332
I'm interested in the
progress of the nation.

1276
01:50:23,416 --> 01:50:24,582
Not yours.

1277
01:50:29,583 --> 01:50:32,415
You are running such a big
ministry at such a young age..

1278
01:50:32,500 --> 01:50:38,415
Look, I know people like you very
well and want to stay away from you.

1279
01:50:39,833 --> 01:50:44,999
I saw your petrochemical project
files. It's full of irregularities.

1280
01:50:45,833 --> 01:50:49,665
No. I haven't come to
talk about the factory..

1281
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:52,415
I've come for your advice.

1282
01:50:54,583 --> 01:50:58,499
Actually I've this burden
on me. A very big burden.

1283
01:51:00,583 --> 01:51:03,415
Your uncle left something with me.

1284
01:51:03,833 --> 01:51:09,999
As a deposit. I'm an
ordinary man sir, I don't know much.

1285
01:51:10,916 --> 01:51:13,082
You just tell me what to do with it.

1286
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:16,832
Should I return it to you..

1287
01:51:16,916 --> 01:51:21,415
..or have it sent overseas,
what do I do? It's very heavy sir.

1288
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:29,249
Anyone would collapse
under it.. me, you.. anybody..

1289
01:51:40,333 --> 01:51:44,249
What happened? What happened?

1290
01:51:45,583 --> 01:51:48,415
Can this helicopter land anywhere?
- Yes.

1291
01:51:52,333 --> 01:51:56,332
Captain! Land at a good sweet shop.

1292
01:51:56,416 --> 01:51:58,832
The minister himself will come for..

1293
01:51:58,916 --> 01:52:02,749
..the inaugural function.
- Wow! Brother Guru.

1294
01:52:21,583 --> 01:52:23,749
Sandeep Mukherjee, Hindustan Times.

1295
01:52:24,416 --> 01:52:26,249
Oh Mr. Mukherjee, come, come.

1296
01:52:26,333 --> 01:52:28,999
I was waiting for you.
I am very pleased.

1297
01:52:29,833 --> 01:52:32,749
When you called up, I was surprised.

1298
01:52:33,166 --> 01:52:35,832
I was surprised to
hear that a newspaper..

1299
01:52:35,916 --> 01:52:38,249
..wanted to write
something nice about us.

1300
01:52:41,166 --> 01:52:42,332
It's quite a big factory.

1301
01:52:42,583 --> 01:52:48,332
Big? It took seventeen
months and five days to build.

1302
01:52:48,416 --> 01:52:53,582
So fast? - Our brother Guru
does everything in a flash.

1303
01:52:54,166 --> 01:52:55,832
How long have you
known brother Guru?

1304
01:52:56,083 --> 01:52:57,499
From Turkey. Yes.

1305
01:52:57,750 --> 01:53:01,165
We delivered petrol cans.

1306
01:53:01,750 --> 01:53:05,165
And today, I'm the
director of this entire factory.

1307
01:53:06,583 --> 01:53:09,332
Where are these machines from?

1308
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:11,082
From Dupoint.

1309
01:53:12,083 --> 01:53:13,749
Do you know where Dupoint is?

1310
01:53:13,916 --> 01:53:14,999
In U.S.A.

1311
01:53:15,833 --> 01:53:19,165
No, it's in America.
- Click it. - Yes.

1312
01:53:19,583 --> 01:53:21,749
What's your output?

1313
01:53:22,166 --> 01:53:23,665
55,000 tonnes.

1314
01:53:24,166 --> 01:53:26,582
55,000 tonnes! Sure?

1315
01:53:26,666 --> 01:53:28,999
Sure?
- I'm a director of the company.

1316
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:33,832
But Ghanshyam sir, I had heard
that you've government permission..

1317
01:53:33,916 --> 01:53:36,665
..to produce only 23,000 tonnes.

1318
01:53:38,583 --> 01:53:41,832
Take this.
- It is not written anywhere that..

1319
01:53:41,916 --> 01:53:43,832
..we can't produce
more than that right?

1320
01:53:44,250 --> 01:53:48,582
Understand.
Government language is such.

1321
01:53:49,833 --> 01:53:51,832
Click it.
- But you have shown machinery..

1322
01:53:51,916 --> 01:53:53,499
..with the capacity
of only 23,000 tonnes.

1323
01:53:53,583 --> 01:53:54,999
So how come the output is double?

1324
01:53:58,000 --> 01:53:59,749
We are hard working people.

1325
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,332
We used the spare
parts lying around.

1326
01:54:02,583 --> 01:54:06,832
Come on, click. - Which means you
have permission for six spinning..

1327
01:54:06,916 --> 01:54:11,915
..lines but have set up
twelve spinning lines.

1328
01:54:13,833 --> 01:54:17,499
One minute. Who are you?

1329
01:54:18,250 --> 01:54:20,832
Great Ghanshyam sir!
You smuggled in six..

1330
01:54:20,916 --> 01:54:23,915
..spinning lines as spare parts
and brought them to the country..

1331
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:27,665
..without paying import duty.
And you set up the whole factory.

1332
01:54:28,083 --> 01:54:31,165
You are masters of conning.

1333
01:54:32,583 --> 01:54:35,415
I asked you who are you?

1334
01:54:35,583 --> 01:54:38,582
I am a reporter, but
you are a smuggler.

1335
01:54:39,583 --> 01:54:43,165
Dog! You breed of a dog!

1336
01:54:43,250 --> 01:54:45,832
Easy. If this photo's printed..

1337
01:54:45,916 --> 01:54:47,249
..just think who will
become the street dog..

1338
01:54:47,750 --> 01:54:52,832
Get out! Get out! I said get out!

1339
01:54:52,916 --> 01:54:55,082
ln the place of one factory,
you are running two.

1340
01:54:55,500 --> 01:54:57,832
Without permission,
without import duty..

1341
01:54:57,916 --> 01:54:58,999
..and without sanction.

1342
01:54:59,250 --> 01:55:01,499
You are cheating the
excise and export departments.

1343
01:55:01,583 --> 01:55:03,499
And you are boasting of
running a big company?

1344
01:55:03,666 --> 01:55:04,832
Tell me, what should I write?

1345
01:55:04,916 --> 01:55:06,665
Get out of here!

1346
01:55:06,833 --> 01:55:10,082
Get out of here
before I lose control!

1347
01:55:10,833 --> 01:55:12,915
Thank you Ghanshyam Das sir.
- Get out or..

1348
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:14,749
Don't miss the papers tomorrow.

1349
01:55:14,833 --> 01:55:15,915
With photo!

1350
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:17,832
One man is working here..

1351
01:55:17,916 --> 01:55:22,415
..and all you are attacking him.

1352
01:55:23,583 --> 01:55:26,832
One day uncle said that nobody..

1353
01:55:26,916 --> 01:55:28,415
..could swim to the other side.
Then, what did he say?

1354
01:55:28,500 --> 01:55:30,415
Take a bet!
- Take a bet!

1355
01:55:30,500 --> 01:55:34,165
And what was the bet?
- Jhumpa's dance!

1356
01:55:34,333 --> 01:55:38,415
And papa jumped in the water.
And how was the water? - Cold.

1357
01:55:38,500 --> 01:55:41,832
Very cold.

1358
01:55:41,916 --> 01:55:44,415
So papa kept swimming..
and what did he see?

1359
01:55:44,666 --> 01:55:47,165
A very big fish.
- A very big fish.

1360
01:55:47,250 --> 01:55:49,499
Which fish was it?
- Shark.

1361
01:55:50,583 --> 01:55:52,082
Listen. phone call for you.

1362
01:55:52,166 --> 01:55:53,832
We're escaping from
the shark.. one minute..

1363
01:55:54,083 --> 01:55:56,999
It's Rinku, Das' daughter, from village.

1364
01:55:59,416 --> 01:56:00,665
Yes, Rinku dear.. tell me.

1365
01:56:49,583 --> 01:56:56,749
Brother Guru. Slit his
wrists with a vegetable knife.

1366
01:56:57,916 --> 01:56:59,582
He was in the back room.

1367
01:57:00,250 --> 01:57:03,415
No one knew for half an hour..

1368
01:57:04,416 --> 01:57:05,499
Enough..

1369
01:57:08,833 --> 01:57:11,249
Go out. You all sit outside.

1370
01:57:29,583 --> 01:57:33,999
I've come to slap you.

1371
01:57:36,083 --> 01:57:37,832
Slap you so hard that this pain..

1372
01:57:37,916 --> 01:57:43,999
..will feel like nothing.
Wants to die!

1373
01:57:46,833 --> 01:57:53,915
Do one thing. Kill me.
Here, slit my wrists too.

1374
01:57:55,416 --> 01:57:57,749
Because after you, it'll be my turn.

1375
01:58:01,500 --> 01:58:03,415
We've been together since Turkey.

1376
01:58:04,583 --> 01:58:06,915
Would you go leaving me alone..
just like that?

1377
01:58:09,750 --> 01:58:17,165
If anything happens to
you because of my mistake..

1378
01:58:21,333 --> 01:58:25,665
..I can't bear it Guru.

1379
01:58:30,166 --> 01:58:36,332
Look. Look.. look at me.
I'm happy now.

1380
01:58:39,166 --> 01:58:40,499
When that headmaster went..

1381
01:58:40,583 --> 01:58:41,749
I didn't shed a tear..

1382
01:58:42,583 --> 01:58:44,832
..step mother died, I didn't cry..

1383
01:58:45,500 --> 01:58:47,832
..it's just that you're so ugly..

1384
01:58:59,583 --> 01:59:04,499
..looking at such an ugly face..
that it's making me cry..

1385
01:59:11,416 --> 01:59:15,749
Guru. Hey Guru.

1386
01:59:17,833 --> 01:59:23,915
Even Jhumpa never
cried looking at my face..

1387
01:59:25,250 --> 01:59:26,332
What?

1388
01:59:26,750 --> 01:59:30,415
Jhumpa, that belly dancer at Turkey.

1389
01:59:30,583 --> 01:59:35,665
Even Jhumpa never
cried looking at my face.

1390
01:59:38,166 --> 01:59:39,249
Das.

1391
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:06,749
Don't do this.

1392
02:00:12,666 --> 02:00:14,332
We have many battles to fight..

1393
02:00:17,500 --> 02:00:19,582
I can't do it without
you Ghanshyam brother..

1394
02:00:36,416 --> 02:00:39,499
Shyam Saxena!
- Come in. The door is open.

1395
02:00:39,583 --> 02:00:41,415
You come out. I want to talk to you.

1396
02:00:41,833 --> 02:00:43,832
I can't. I'm in the kitchen.

1397
02:00:50,083 --> 02:00:51,165
Come straight, this side.

1398
02:00:55,833 --> 02:00:56,915
What kind of a man are you?

1399
02:00:59,583 --> 02:01:00,915
Do you even know what you're doing?

1400
02:01:03,166 --> 02:01:07,999
Seasoning.. will
you eat? I cook well.

1401
02:01:08,166 --> 02:01:11,499
You're insane. Why
are you doing this?

1402
02:01:11,666 --> 02:01:13,749
For fame, money? To threaten?
What for?

1403
02:01:17,166 --> 02:01:21,415
Do you know five foreign companies
have invested in Shakti Corporation?

1404
02:01:24,583 --> 02:01:30,665
Yes, so?
- All five are bogus companies.

1405
02:01:31,333 --> 02:01:32,415
All are fake ones.

1406
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:36,082
Can you prove it?

1407
02:01:37,916 --> 02:01:40,165
Truth is truth even without proof.

1408
02:01:40,583 --> 02:01:42,665
Can you prove it or not?

1409
02:01:43,916 --> 02:01:45,832
Good, I can. I can also prove..

1410
02:01:45,916 --> 02:01:48,832
..you've joined hands
with ministers to convert..

1411
02:01:48,916 --> 02:01:51,915
..non-convertible
debentures into shares.

1412
02:01:52,583 --> 02:01:53,832
Shakti Corp's reach is in every..

1413
02:01:53,916 --> 02:01:55,915
..department of the government.
Right from..

1414
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:59,082
..the peon to minister,
everyone is part of your family.

1415
02:02:00,333 --> 02:02:03,332
You know the rules of the government
even before the public knows.

1416
02:02:03,416 --> 02:02:07,582
Using that information,
you play with public money.

1417
02:02:09,333 --> 02:02:12,999
Do you have conscious
or you've mortgaged it?

1418
02:02:14,416 --> 02:02:15,499
What is this?

1419
02:02:18,833 --> 02:02:19,915
Can't you understand on seeing that?

1420
02:02:27,500 --> 02:02:28,582
You got married?

1421
02:02:29,416 --> 02:02:30,915
Should I have asked
you for that also?

1422
02:02:33,333 --> 02:02:38,082
Where is she? Meenu!

1423
02:02:45,666 --> 02:02:48,082
Meenu!
- Brother Guru!

1424
02:02:49,666 --> 02:02:50,749
Coming.

1425
02:02:52,916 --> 02:02:53,999
Meenu!

1426
02:02:57,916 --> 02:03:01,082
How come you're here?

1427
02:03:02,583 --> 02:03:03,665
What to do?

1428
02:03:04,250 --> 02:03:06,415
You just weren't leaving
sister and come to me.

1429
02:03:06,833 --> 02:03:08,582
I was forced to get married.

1430
02:03:09,083 --> 02:03:10,165
You didn't invite me.

1431
02:03:11,250 --> 02:03:13,999
No one had come. Not even grandpa.

1432
02:03:15,166 --> 02:03:18,999
He kept his favorites
reporter and kicked me out.

1433
02:03:19,833 --> 02:03:23,082
He said that I'd become
a little too independent.

1434
02:03:27,166 --> 02:03:29,249
There are 60 crore
people in lndia.

1435
02:03:30,416 --> 02:03:32,665
Didn't you get any other
fool to get married to?

1436
02:03:33,083 --> 02:03:39,665
But he's a good guy. Have
you come to fight with him?

1437
02:03:40,750 --> 02:03:44,582
Yes. I thought I would
say a few things to him.

1438
02:03:44,833 --> 02:03:51,082
But on seeing you, my
mouth got shut. - Come.

1439
02:03:51,333 --> 02:03:58,665
Hey Shyam. Make sure you love my
Jalkukdi more than you hate me.

1440
02:03:59,333 --> 02:04:00,915
Do you need proof for that as well?

1441
02:04:10,583 --> 02:04:14,832
What happened? You look very weak.

1442
02:04:15,166 --> 02:04:16,665
You've become very fat.

1443
02:04:18,583 --> 02:04:23,999
Weak.
- Fat. - Weak. - Fat.

1444
02:04:27,166 --> 02:04:28,499
Nothing is going to
Change between us.

1445
02:04:30,250 --> 02:04:32,832
When you hear my voice..

1446
02:04:32,916 --> 02:04:35,332
..be certain that you're
doing something wrong.

1447
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:44,749
The louder your voice,
the more I'll grow.

1448
02:04:53,333 --> 02:04:56,499
I'll leave. Jalkukdi.

1449
02:05:08,583 --> 02:05:10,082
Give us our money back.

1450
02:05:10,583 --> 02:05:13,082
Yes, come on.

1451
02:05:17,333 --> 02:05:18,832
Give us our money back.

1452
02:05:18,916 --> 02:05:21,915
Gurukanth Desai
salutes the Shakti family!

1453
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:23,415
What salute? Answer us!

1454
02:05:24,166 --> 02:05:26,249
We don't want a salute. Answer us!

1455
02:05:27,750 --> 02:05:33,249
You're angry. Good.

1456
02:05:33,916 --> 02:05:35,582
I'm very angry too.

1457
02:05:37,250 --> 02:05:38,582
You've asked me a lot of questions.

1458
02:05:38,666 --> 02:05:40,249
Now shall I ask you a few questions?

1459
02:05:44,833 --> 02:05:47,832
If someone flings
muck at our family..

1460
02:05:47,916 --> 02:05:52,165
..throws stones,
what do we do? Tell me.

1461
02:05:53,583 --> 02:05:55,249
Do we start fighting
amongst ourselves?

1462
02:05:56,250 --> 02:05:57,832
Can a family survive like that?

1463
02:06:01,250 --> 02:06:03,832
You ask me why the
papers are writing..

1464
02:06:03,916 --> 02:06:06,165
..articles against us.
I'll tell you.

1465
02:06:06,250 --> 02:06:07,332
Not the newspaper..

1466
02:06:08,083 --> 02:06:11,999
Because we are commoners,
middle class.

1467
02:06:13,583 --> 02:06:18,915
And those who are
already rich don't like this.

1468
02:06:20,416 --> 02:06:22,749
We want to write our own destiny.

1469
02:06:23,583 --> 02:06:25,082
They hate all this.

1470
02:06:25,583 --> 02:06:26,915
That is all right.

1471
02:06:27,166 --> 02:06:29,332
But do you have a reply to this?

1472
02:06:29,500 --> 02:06:30,582
Answer!

1473
02:06:32,833 --> 02:06:33,915
What has happened to our money?

1474
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:35,999
What's happened? Answer!

1475
02:06:37,583 --> 02:06:40,915
Next year, our turnover
will be hundred crores.

1476
02:06:41,250 --> 02:06:44,415
You have stolen and
made us thieves too.

1477
02:06:45,166 --> 02:06:47,332
Who was that?
- You're a smuggler!

1478
02:06:47,416 --> 02:06:48,499
Who was that?

1479
02:06:48,916 --> 02:06:51,415
You steal! Give us back our money!

1480
02:06:52,833 --> 02:06:56,415
We will make bigger profits;
I will not give your money.

1481
02:06:56,583 --> 02:07:01,915
You are a thief! You wear fancy
suits and drive away in a Mercedes.

1482
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:03,582
We'll be out on the streets!

1483
02:07:04,166 --> 02:07:05,749
We want justice!

1484
02:07:06,166 --> 02:07:07,749
Down with brother Guru!
- Down with brother Guru!

1485
02:07:11,333 --> 02:07:12,832
Down with brother Guru!

1486
02:07:18,250 --> 02:07:19,665
Give our money back.

1487
02:07:19,750 --> 02:07:24,249
Down with brother Guru!

1488
02:08:11,666 --> 02:08:14,749
We didn't have money
to white-wash the house.

1489
02:08:16,083 --> 02:08:18,999
You said the house
looks best the way it is.

1490
02:08:19,583 --> 02:08:20,665
It looks like a home.

1491
02:08:26,666 --> 02:08:29,165
Were you telling the truth or
were you trying to pacify me?

1492
02:08:29,250 --> 02:08:30,332
Wallet.

1493
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:34,499
You would forget your wallet.

1494
02:08:40,666 --> 02:08:41,749
What happened?

1495
02:08:42,166 --> 02:08:43,249
I forgot my wallet.

1496
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:49,832
I would climb two steps..

1497
02:08:49,916 --> 02:08:52,082
..at a time to come to you.

1498
02:08:57,166 --> 02:08:59,999
And you would stand right here.

1499
02:09:09,583 --> 02:09:10,665
I won't give it.

1500
02:09:11,583 --> 02:09:14,165
Your brother is waiting downstairs.
He will kill me.

1501
02:09:14,583 --> 02:09:16,082
You can't die for me?

1502
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:20,249
If I die, who will you fight with?

1503
02:09:23,083 --> 02:09:24,332
praise me.
- What?

1504
02:09:24,833 --> 02:09:25,999
Say something nice.

1505
02:09:29,166 --> 02:09:31,249
You shine brighter than polyester.

1506
02:09:32,333 --> 02:09:36,415
Don't talk like a laundryman.
Always talking about polyester.

1507
02:09:39,333 --> 02:09:41,082
You're the most
beautiful girl in the locality.

1508
02:09:42,250 --> 02:09:43,582
So you look at others?

1509
02:09:44,166 --> 02:09:47,582
I don't. Now give it.

1510
02:09:51,083 --> 02:09:52,165
Forget it tomorrow as well.

1511
02:09:54,916 --> 02:09:56,749
As long as you're with me,
how can I remember anything?

1512
02:09:58,583 --> 02:09:59,665
Beast!

1513
02:10:03,583 --> 02:10:05,165
How do I look to you?

1514
02:10:14,833 --> 02:10:16,665
Your face resembles my husband's.

1515
02:10:21,166 --> 02:10:23,332
Do I look like a thief or smuggler?

1516
02:10:29,833 --> 02:10:33,499
Neither are you a
thief nor a weakling.

1517
02:10:35,500 --> 02:10:39,499
"Why do you trouble me?"

1518
02:10:39,583 --> 02:10:43,665
"You tell what you do."

1519
02:10:43,750 --> 02:10:47,832
"The king of liars. Tell me."

1520
02:10:47,916 --> 02:10:48,999
What if my brother comes?

1521
02:10:49,583 --> 02:10:53,832
Guru.
- "Dusk in your eyes."

1522
02:10:54,666 --> 02:10:57,082
Always arrives at the wrong time.

1523
02:10:57,666 --> 02:11:01,249
"Sometimes dawn in my eyes."

1524
02:11:01,333 --> 02:11:03,915
Guru, Guru, Guru.

1525
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:05,165
"Tells a story."

1526
02:11:05,583 --> 02:11:08,665
Sister. Where's everybody?

1527
02:11:08,750 --> 02:11:09,999
"Open your eyes."

1528
02:11:12,583 --> 02:11:13,665
poor guy.

1529
02:11:17,416 --> 02:11:18,499
poor thing.

1530
02:11:21,583 --> 02:11:22,665
Beast!

1531
02:11:22,750 --> 02:11:23,832
"You are unique."

1532
02:11:25,833 --> 02:11:27,582
Chilly queen!

1533
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:30,915
Me?
- Who else?

1534
02:11:31,250 --> 02:11:33,832
Ready to fight.

1535
02:11:34,750 --> 02:11:38,165
Lies. You used to beat poor old me.

1536
02:11:38,833 --> 02:11:40,082
When did I hit you?

1537
02:11:43,166 --> 02:11:44,249
Here, like this.

1538
02:11:48,083 --> 02:11:49,165
Again.

1539
02:11:54,500 --> 02:11:55,582
You will lose.

1540
02:11:59,333 --> 02:12:00,582
What's happened to you?

1541
02:12:04,916 --> 02:12:05,999
Forgotten how to play?

1542
02:12:12,250 --> 02:12:13,332
What happened, Guru?

1543
02:12:15,666 --> 02:12:19,249
Guru.. Guru.. Guru.

1544
02:12:22,583 --> 02:12:23,665
Guru.

1545
02:12:33,083 --> 02:12:35,332
I am going down to get an ambulance.

1546
02:12:36,166 --> 02:12:39,082
Are you listening?
Just keep breathing.

1547
02:12:40,166 --> 02:12:42,082
Ok? Don't be scared?

1548
02:12:42,166 --> 02:12:43,915
I'll be right back.

1549
02:13:12,250 --> 02:13:13,999
Brother Guru has had
a paralytic stroke.

1550
02:13:15,833 --> 02:13:16,915
There was a telex from the p.T. I.

1551
02:13:17,666 --> 02:13:22,415
You know what that means? He
can't move the right side at all.

1552
02:13:23,333 --> 02:13:26,915
He can neither move his hands,
nor legs. Can't do any work.

1553
02:13:27,500 --> 02:13:31,915
He's younger to me by at least
20-25 years. At least 20 years.

1554
02:13:33,833 --> 02:13:35,582
An attack at this age? How?

1555
02:13:39,416 --> 02:13:40,582
Maybe because of us.

1556
02:13:43,583 --> 02:13:44,665
What?

1557
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:51,915
You, me, Swatantra,
everybody is after him.

1558
02:13:55,916 --> 02:13:57,915
In fact another article
is coming out tomorrow.

1559
02:14:00,666 --> 02:14:01,749
Shall I stop it?

1560
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:08,665
Is what you are printing the truth?
- 100 percent.

1561
02:14:11,083 --> 02:14:14,915
Then print it. Why
fear printing the truth?

1562
02:14:16,833 --> 02:14:21,082
Which hospital is he in? - Bombay
Hospital. - Bombay Hospital.

1563
02:14:22,083 --> 02:14:23,332
Are you going to see him?

1564
02:14:26,416 --> 02:14:30,249
No. Why should I?

1565
02:14:32,833 --> 02:14:36,915
I won't go there. Why should I?

1566
02:14:40,333 --> 02:14:41,415
I won't go.

1567
02:15:27,083 --> 02:15:28,165
Grandpa.

1568
02:15:35,083 --> 02:15:38,249
Checking to see if he's alive?

1569
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:42,082
He is.

1570
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:45,415
ln two more months, I'll make
him fit enough to fight you.

1571
02:16:00,583 --> 02:16:05,499
"I have been awake for long.."

1572
02:16:05,583 --> 02:16:12,665
"Let me sleep for some time.."

1573
02:16:13,250 --> 02:16:19,249
"There is still some night left.."

1574
02:16:20,083 --> 02:16:26,165
"Let morning come.."

1575
02:16:28,250 --> 02:16:33,249
"The incomplete dreams that.."

1576
02:16:33,333 --> 02:16:39,999
"Couldn't be fulfilled.."

1577
02:16:40,750 --> 02:16:46,415
"Once during this sleep.."

1578
02:16:47,666 --> 02:16:53,499
"Let those dreams be sowed.."

1579
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:54,082
CT scan.

1580
02:17:55,500 --> 02:17:57,332
What is that?
- It is a..

1581
02:17:57,416 --> 02:17:58,665
We want to meet Mr. Gurukanth Desai.

1582
02:17:59,583 --> 02:18:00,665
You?

1583
02:18:00,750 --> 02:18:03,665
Ashok Agarwal, Justice Department.
We have summons for him.

1584
02:18:04,500 --> 02:18:05,665
For what?

1585
02:18:05,750 --> 02:18:07,832
On the 16th of October, there is
Thapar Commission's final hearing..

1586
02:18:07,916 --> 02:18:09,915
..against Shakti Corporation.

1587
02:18:10,500 --> 02:18:12,915
But he's asleep.

1588
02:18:13,166 --> 02:18:14,582
It is a notice for that.
I have to give it to him.

1589
02:18:14,666 --> 02:18:18,999
Look. Yes.. but visiting hours
are over.. please come later.

1590
02:18:20,833 --> 02:18:22,165
We have permission
from the High Court.

1591
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:25,915
You will have to appear
before the Thapar Commission..

1592
02:18:26,083 --> 02:18:29,499
.. at ten thirty on the
16th of October, 1980.

1593
02:18:29,750 --> 02:18:34,915
For the enquiry on any
condition. You have to sign here.

1594
02:18:48,250 --> 02:18:49,665
He's asking if you
would like some tea.

1595
02:18:54,333 --> 02:18:56,415
Here.
- Only on the copy.

1596
02:19:06,666 --> 02:19:08,915
Take this.
- Thank you.

1597
02:19:10,916 --> 02:19:12,915
Brother Guru will
see you on the 16th.

1598
02:19:18,666 --> 02:19:20,499
please come fully prepared.

1599
02:19:42,083 --> 02:19:47,499
Mr. Desai. We are here
to assess if the charges..

1600
02:19:47,583 --> 02:19:50,915
..against you and
your company are true.

1601
02:19:51,500 --> 02:19:55,082
And if.. - Just a minute please.
- I haven't finished.

1602
02:20:01,250 --> 02:20:03,665
And if the charges are found true.

1603
02:20:04,750 --> 02:20:06,832
Then this Commission
will recommend suitable..

1604
02:20:06,916 --> 02:20:08,915
..punitive action to the government.

1605
02:20:10,583 --> 02:20:11,915
Yes, you may speak.

1606
02:20:15,250 --> 02:20:17,582
Sir, brother Guru has a request.

1607
02:20:18,666 --> 02:20:21,082
Could you please repeat
everything that you just said..

1608
02:20:21,833 --> 02:20:22,915
..in Hindi?

1609
02:20:26,833 --> 02:20:29,999
We're villagers..
our English is weak.

1610
02:20:33,500 --> 02:20:35,999
Both my language and I are right.

1611
02:20:37,583 --> 02:20:40,415
Which one would you
like to test, Shri Desai?

1612
02:20:49,083 --> 02:20:51,582
What test? You can take our lives..

1613
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:53,082
But whatever you do..

1614
02:20:53,166 --> 02:20:54,665
..just do it in Hindi.

1615
02:20:55,083 --> 02:20:57,332
Will you be answering.. or will he?

1616
02:20:57,833 --> 02:21:00,749
The answers are his,
only the voice is mine.

1617
02:21:01,083 --> 02:21:06,082
Is your wife a Shakti employee?

1618
02:21:06,833 --> 02:21:09,082
An officer? Or a director?

1619
02:21:14,416 --> 02:21:17,332
If you aren't, what are
you doing here? please leave.

1620
02:21:34,833 --> 02:21:39,582
Sir I am the owner of Shakti.
lnitial promoter..

1621
02:21:39,666 --> 02:21:42,999
..and 50 percent
shareholder in the holding company.

1622
02:21:43,833 --> 02:21:45,832
Sir here are the Memorandum
and Articles of Association..

1623
02:21:45,916 --> 02:21:49,415
..of the holding company
and the annual returns.

1624
02:21:54,666 --> 02:21:56,415
Do you know the meaning of this?

1625
02:21:58,500 --> 02:22:01,165
You'll also have to
go to jail with him.

1626
02:22:04,416 --> 02:22:05,915
We are 50 percent partners, sir.

1627
02:22:06,583 --> 02:22:08,582
Wherever we go, we'll go together.

1628
02:23:15,666 --> 02:23:21,832
"This is a critical matter..

1629
02:23:21,916 --> 02:23:28,915
..for the people crazy in love."

1630
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:33,832
"This is a critical matter..

1631
02:23:33,916 --> 02:23:37,832
..for the people crazy in love."

1632
02:23:37,916 --> 02:23:44,832
"The clouds playing..

1633
02:23:44,916 --> 02:23:50,999
..with the snow."

1634
02:23:53,583 --> 02:23:56,665
Minister of lndustry '68-'72.
Ministry of Finance..

1635
02:23:56,750 --> 02:23:59,832
..'73-'78,
Under-Secretary Development..

1636
02:23:59,916 --> 02:24:00,999
..Chief Secretary Finance..

1637
02:24:01,083 --> 02:24:02,832
Your company has
given all of them land..

1638
02:24:02,916 --> 02:24:04,915
..gifts and money. Why?

1639
02:24:05,166 --> 02:24:09,999
It has now been proved sir. He
raises his own share prices.

1640
02:24:10,083 --> 02:24:11,582
He has a nexus with the brokers.

1641
02:24:11,666 --> 02:24:13,082
We have our own broking company.

1642
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:18,082
He has attempted a hostile
takeover of two companies.

1643
02:24:18,166 --> 02:24:20,915
The show cause notice
must be given to him, sir.

1644
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:24,332
lmport duty evasion, 12 crore..
for four factories.

1645
02:24:25,166 --> 02:24:28,082
Excise duty evasion from '74 to '77.

1646
02:24:28,500 --> 02:24:30,915
Total evasion of penalty,
Rs.14 crore..

1647
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:32,749
..27 lakhs, four thousand.

1648
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:35,332
He converts non
convertible debentures.

1649
02:24:35,416 --> 02:24:36,832
He then turns these
debentures into shares..

1650
02:24:36,916 --> 02:24:38,832
..and clears all his debts.

1651
02:24:38,916 --> 02:24:40,915
These conversions
should be disallowed.

1652
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:44,415
The matter is subjudice.
Disallowed! Disallowed!

1653
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:57,499
Mr. Desai, many allegations
have come up against you today.

1654
02:24:58,833 --> 02:25:00,665
Do you have a response?

1655
02:25:04,583 --> 02:25:10,915
This hearing is in camera only
today. You get it? ln private.

1656
02:25:12,500 --> 02:25:15,332
Tomorrow, the press and
the public will be here.

1657
02:25:17,166 --> 02:25:20,999
You'd better accept all
the charges today itself.

1658
02:25:24,833 --> 02:25:26,665
You are being given an opportunity.

1659
02:25:27,416 --> 02:25:28,832
If there is anything
you would like to say..

1660
02:25:28,916 --> 02:25:30,665
..in your defense you
may do so now.

1661
02:25:45,250 --> 02:25:47,165
I have only one thing to say.

1662
02:25:57,500 --> 02:25:58,582
Greetings.

1663
02:26:13,083 --> 02:26:19,082
"I love the night.."

1664
02:26:20,250 --> 02:26:25,832
"I love the..

1665
02:26:25,916 --> 02:26:33,415
..silence of the night."

1666
02:26:34,833 --> 02:26:40,915
"I love the night."

1667
02:26:42,083 --> 02:26:48,832
"The brightness in the morning..

1668
02:26:49,666 --> 02:26:56,249
..and the silent night."

1669
02:26:56,916 --> 02:27:09,415
"I love the brightness."

1670
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:18,832
Down with brother Guru!

1671
02:27:18,916 --> 02:27:21,249
Hey, let go of me!

1672
02:27:24,250 --> 02:27:26,915
I drive a taxi from
Wadala to Churchgate.

1673
02:27:28,250 --> 02:27:31,999
I've Shakti shares. I've got my
three daughters married with that.

1674
02:27:32,916 --> 02:27:33,999
That's all I wanted to say.

1675
02:27:34,583 --> 02:27:35,832
I wanted to thank you.

1676
02:27:36,583 --> 02:27:39,332
Don't worry..
because, I am with you.

1677
02:27:58,083 --> 02:28:01,915
please be silent.

1678
02:28:11,083 --> 02:28:13,832
This commission has heard
all the arguments against..

1679
02:28:13,916 --> 02:28:17,415
..and in defense of
Shakti Corporation.

1680
02:28:18,416 --> 02:28:20,832
The commission will
declare it's report..

1681
02:28:20,916 --> 02:28:23,582
..and recommendations
after the lunch session.

1682
02:28:29,083 --> 02:28:32,999
Brother Guru requests your
permission to say something.

1683
02:28:37,250 --> 02:28:38,665
He was given an
opportunity yesterday..

1684
02:28:39,500 --> 02:28:41,249
..but he just said
greetings and left.

1685
02:28:45,833 --> 02:28:49,665
We were told that
your voice is very weak.

1686
02:28:54,416 --> 02:28:59,999
I'm a businessman sir. I
spend everything very carefully.

1687
02:29:01,833 --> 02:29:04,415
I saved my voice for today.

1688
02:29:06,166 --> 02:29:08,165
Beware of what you say.
The public is present..

1689
02:29:08,250 --> 02:29:10,915
..what you say could go against you.

1690
02:29:14,083 --> 02:29:15,832
Why fear the public..

1691
02:29:16,916 --> 02:29:19,915
..I am the public. May I speak?

1692
02:29:21,416 --> 02:29:22,499
Five minutes.

1693
02:29:30,666 --> 02:29:34,582
May I stand, or do I
need a license for that too?

1694
02:29:46,416 --> 02:29:47,582
Enough. Enough.

1695
02:30:01,500 --> 02:30:03,582
You say I'm against the law.

1696
02:30:06,833 --> 02:30:10,332
Forty years ago, another
man was against the law.

1697
02:30:13,333 --> 02:30:15,332
Today we call him Bapu.

1698
02:30:18,666 --> 02:30:24,415
In his time slavery was the law..
he wrote a new law..

1699
02:30:24,833 --> 02:30:26,249
..our freedom.

1700
02:30:30,250 --> 02:30:31,582
I'm not Bapu.

1701
02:30:33,583 --> 02:30:35,582
All I know is business..

1702
02:30:37,833 --> 02:30:40,915
..and to work hard, and poverty.

1703
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:48,832
I came to Bombay with two shirts..

1704
02:30:48,916 --> 02:30:50,332
..a wife and a brother-in-law.

1705
02:30:52,833 --> 02:30:54,415
I thought I'll do business.

1706
02:30:56,333 --> 02:30:59,499
But when I reached here I saw that
all doors for business were closed.

1707
02:31:02,166 --> 02:31:04,582
If they opened, it
was only for the rich.

1708
02:31:08,416 --> 02:31:12,332
They were doors made by
the government. Yours.

1709
02:31:14,416 --> 02:31:17,915
They either opened
with a bribe or a kick.

1710
02:31:18,166 --> 02:31:19,332
I did both.

1711
02:31:20,750 --> 02:31:22,665
Where I had to kick, I kicked.

1712
02:31:23,500 --> 02:31:25,915
Where you wanted me
to salute, I saluted.

1713
02:31:29,083 --> 02:31:34,332
And today you ask why
this man kicks so much..

1714
02:31:34,833 --> 02:31:36,499
He salutes too much.

1715
02:31:41,250 --> 02:31:42,499
What are you angry about?

1716
02:31:44,333 --> 02:31:47,915
My growth or the speed of my growth?

1717
02:31:50,500 --> 02:31:51,999
Or is everybody angry because..

1718
02:31:52,583 --> 02:31:54,999
I've surpassed the
boundaries of an ordinary villager?

1719
02:31:59,083 --> 02:32:00,915
You've made allegations against me..

1720
02:32:01,500 --> 02:32:05,249
..excise, custom, income tax,
this tax.. that tax.

1721
02:32:07,166 --> 02:32:08,999
When I started business..

1722
02:32:09,333 --> 02:32:11,415
..I didn't even know the
meaning of these words.

1723
02:32:15,333 --> 02:32:17,915
I fell many times before I learnt.

1724
02:32:24,083 --> 02:32:25,832
To save money, I walked 20 kms..

1725
02:32:25,916 --> 02:32:30,332
..from pydhonie carrying huge
bales of polyester on my head.

1726
02:32:34,916 --> 02:32:37,332
I know the value of money.

1727
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:44,832
If there was money to be made..

1728
02:32:45,083 --> 02:32:49,165
..I made it. But
not just for myself.

1729
02:32:50,833 --> 02:32:53,332
For my 3 million
shareholders as well.

1730
02:32:58,250 --> 02:33:00,082
You have about 3 minutes left.

1731
02:33:08,833 --> 02:33:13,915
I don't know how to play golf
and I don't go to horse races..

1732
02:33:15,416 --> 02:33:17,999
..but I'm a solid
player in my business.

1733
02:33:20,916 --> 02:33:22,499
I know how to make polyester..

1734
02:33:24,833 --> 02:33:27,915
..fiber.. chemicals..

1735
02:33:28,666 --> 02:33:31,915
of the best quality.
At the cheapest price.

1736
02:33:33,916 --> 02:33:37,999
Is that my mistake?
Should I apologize for that?

1737
02:33:42,583 --> 02:33:44,249
I roamed around carrying cans
as a petrol pump attendant..

1738
02:33:45,250 --> 02:33:49,249
..just like our country goes
to the World Bank begging.

1739
02:33:49,333 --> 02:33:51,332
"Give us money we
want to make roads."

1740
02:33:52,500 --> 02:33:53,999
Why can't we change our destiny?

1741
02:33:54,166 --> 02:33:55,665
Ours and our country's?

1742
02:33:56,833 --> 02:33:59,165
You want me to remain a
petrol bunk attendant..

1743
02:34:00,250 --> 02:34:02,832
..and our country to beg, forever.

1744
02:34:04,833 --> 02:34:06,332
Why can't we reach the top?

1745
02:34:07,583 --> 02:34:09,499
Why are we called the third world?

1746
02:34:10,333 --> 02:34:12,332
We have as much right to
be a first world country..

1747
02:34:12,416 --> 02:34:18,082
..and we can be! We can
reach there at the top.

1748
02:34:22,583 --> 02:34:25,165
I've lost a lot reaching here..

1749
02:34:28,833 --> 02:34:31,332
I lost this hand. Lousy
thing hangs uselessly!

1750
02:34:37,083 --> 02:34:39,165
And by the time this enquiry ends..

1751
02:34:39,833 --> 02:34:41,582
..I don't know what
else I will lose..

1752
02:34:43,833 --> 02:34:45,999
..my voice, my mind.

1753
02:34:48,083 --> 02:34:50,665
But there is one thing you
can never snatch from me.

1754
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:59,832
My courage. I won't lose that.
Because my courage..

1755
02:35:00,166 --> 02:35:01,582
..is the common man's courage..

1756
02:35:02,083 --> 02:35:03,415
..this country's courage.

1757
02:35:06,666 --> 02:35:08,915
All of you want to
stop me, don't you?

1758
02:35:09,833 --> 02:35:14,832
I'm not alone.. the whole
country is moving ahead with me.

1759
02:35:16,250 --> 02:35:17,832
And neither you nor your laws..

1760
02:35:17,916 --> 02:35:20,915
..have the strength
to stop the country.

1761
02:35:23,833 --> 02:35:26,832
The doors you want to keep closed,
are opening up..

1762
02:35:27,333 --> 02:35:28,915
..we have stuck our
foot through the doors..

1763
02:35:29,166 --> 02:35:30,999
..and our feet are very strong.

1764
02:35:35,250 --> 02:35:38,082
What enquiry will you
conduct on the nation's progress?

1765
02:35:39,333 --> 02:35:41,665
And which enquiry will be
able to stop us? Tell me!

1766
02:35:56,166 --> 02:35:57,915
You gave me five minutes.

1767
02:35:59,500 --> 02:36:01,832
I've finished talking every
thing in four and a half minutes..

1768
02:36:04,083 --> 02:36:07,249
30 seconds profit.

1769
02:36:10,583 --> 02:36:12,332
That's business.

1770
02:36:14,583 --> 02:36:17,082
If you want to punish
me for that as well..

1771
02:36:17,166 --> 02:36:18,249
..go ahead.

1772
02:36:20,083 --> 02:36:22,915
Gurukanth Desai is not
scared of punishment.

1773
02:37:01,583 --> 02:37:04,332
What do you think? Is
he a genius or a thug?

1774
02:37:04,583 --> 02:37:05,915
Both.

1775
02:37:06,833 --> 02:37:11,915
Whatever it is, we
can't hang him, can we?

1776
02:37:16,083 --> 02:37:18,832
Out of the 29
allegations leveled against..

1777
02:37:18,916 --> 02:37:21,332
..Shakti Corporation, 2 are proved.

1778
02:37:21,416 --> 02:37:27,832
Shakti Corporation is fined Rs.
6.3 millon and 96,000.

1779
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:29,832
The rest of the
allegations are scrapped.

1780
02:37:41,583 --> 02:37:44,915
Gurukanth Desai
salutes the Shakti family.

1781
02:37:57,083 --> 02:37:58,415
"Don't dream."

1782
02:38:01,666 --> 02:38:03,665
"Dreams never come true."

1783
02:38:05,166 --> 02:38:06,999
My father would say.

1784
02:38:09,583 --> 02:38:15,249
But I shall dream. We all dreamt.

1785
02:38:18,083 --> 02:38:19,832
Dreamt of becoming the..

1786
02:38:19,916 --> 02:38:22,332
..biggest company in lndia.

1787
02:38:26,833 --> 02:38:29,832
Has our dream come true?

1788
02:38:29,916 --> 02:38:37,582
Yes.
- And, do we stop now?

1789
02:38:37,916 --> 02:38:40,415
No.

1790
02:38:40,583 --> 02:38:42,582
Or do we dream more, courageously?

1791
02:38:42,916 --> 02:38:45,999
Yes.

1792
02:38:46,083 --> 02:38:49,665
Shall we become the
world's biggest company?

1793
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:51,999
Yes..

1794
02:39:05,833 --> 02:39:08,249
Shall we tell the
world that we are coming?

1795
02:39:08,333 --> 02:39:10,165
Yes..

1796
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
